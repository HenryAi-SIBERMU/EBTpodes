    "abstract": "Energy is a fundamental element for development in all countries. However, the problem is that not all people have access to energy, especially in Indonesia where 42% of the population lives in rural areas. The Indonesian government has created a Village Funds program to improve rural and energy development. This study aims to uncover the effectiveness of using the Village Fund, especially for affordable and clean energy, to support achieving Sustainable Development Goal number 7. The method used in this research is a case study method using document study and several interviews with the member of Fiscal Ministry of Indonesia. The result shows that after mapping all Village Funds activities during 2018-2020, Kalimantan and Sulawesi become the most extensive realization of the use of Village Funds to alternative and renewable energy activities. To achieve SDGs number 7, the allocation of Village Funds for renewable energy development still needs to be increased, especially in the island of Java. The role of government in making Village Funds policy is still required. Village development should not only focus on infrastructure, but the affordability of village communities to develop clean and renewable energy is also important.",

    "abstract": "India, the second largest agro-based economy with year-round crop cultivation, generates a large amount of agricultural waste, including crop residues. In the absence of adequate sustainable management practices, approximately 92 seems a very small number of metric tons of crop waste is burned every year in India, causing excessive particulate matter emissions and air pollution. Crop residue burning has become a major environmental problem causing health issues as well as contributing to global warming. Composting, biochar production and mechanization are a few effective sustainable techniques that can help to curtail the issue while retaining the nutrients present in the crop residue in the soil. The government of India has attempted to curtail this problem, through numerous measures and campaigns designed to promote sustainable management methods such as converting crop residue into energy. However, the alarming rise of air pollution levels caused by crop residue burning in the city of Delhi and other northern areas in India observed in recent years, especially in and after the year of 2015, suggest that the issues is not yet under control. The solution to crop residue burning lies in the effective implementation of sustainable management practices with Government interventions and policies. This manuscript addresses the underlying technical as well as policy issues that has prevented India from achieving a long-lasting solution and also potential solutions that have been overlooked. However, effective implementation of these techniques also requires us to look at other socioeconomic aspects that had not been considered. This manuscript also discusses some of the policy considerations and functionality based on the analyses and current practices. The agricultural waste sector can benefit immensely from some of the examples from other waste sectors such as the municipal solid waste (MSW) and wastewater management where collection, segregation, recycling and disposal are institutionalized to secure an operational system. Active stakeholder involvement including education and empowerment of farmers along with technical solutions and product manufacturing can also assist tremendously. Even though the issue of crop residue burning touches many sectors, such as environment, agriculture, economy, social aspects, education, and energy, the past governmental efforts mainly revolved around agriculture and energy. This sectorial thinking is another barrier that needs to be broken. The government of India as well as governments of other developing countries can benefit from the emerging concept of nexus thinking in managing environmental resources. Nexus thinking promotes a higher-level integration and higher level of stakeholder involvement that goes beyond the disciplinary boundaries, providing a supporting platform to solve issues such as crop residue burning.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The primary objective for deploying renewable energy in India is to advance economic development, improve energy security, improve access to energy, and mitigate climate change. Sustainable development is possible by use of sustainable energy and by ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for citizens. Strong government support and the increasingly opportune economic situation have pushed India to be one of the top leaders in the world’s most attractive renewable energy markets. The government has designed policies, programs, and a liberal environment to attract foreign investments to ramp up the country in the renewable energy market at a rapid rate. It is anticipated that the renewable energy sector can create a large number of domestic jobs over the following years. This paper aims to present significant achievements, prospects, projections, generation of electricity, as well as challenges and investment and employment opportunities due to the development of renewable energy in India. In this review, we have identified the various obstacles faced by the renewable sector. The recommendations based on the review outcomes will provide useful information for policymakers, innovators, project developers, investors, industries, associated stakeholders and departments, researchers, and scientists.",

    "abstract": "Clean and environment-friendly energy harvesting are of prime interest today as it is one of the key enablers in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as well as accelerates social progress and enhances living standards. India, the second-most populous nation with a population of 1.353 billion, is one of the largest consumers of fossil fuels in the world which is responsible for global warming. An ever-increasing population is projected until 2050, and consequently, the energy demand in the upcoming decades will be co-accelerated by the rapid industrial growth. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) with the support of National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog is working to achieve the Indian Government's target of attaining 175 GW through renewable energy resources. Many Indian states are currently increasing their renewable energy capacity in an objective to meet future energy demand. The review paper discusses in-depth about the three Indian states, namely Karnataka, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, which pioneers the renewable energy production in India. The global energy scenario was discussed in detail with Indian contrast. Further, the barriers to the development of renewable energy generation and policies of the Indian government are discussed in detail to promote renewable energy generation throughout India as well as globally since the challenges are similar for other nations. This study analyzed various prospects of the country in renewable energy which has been done in a purpose to help the scholars, researchers, and policymakers of the nation, as it gives an insight into the present renewable energy scenario of the country.",

    "abstract": "The electrical power sector plays an important role in the economic growth and development of every country around the world. Total global demand for electric energy is growing both in developed and developing economies. The commitment to the decarbonization of economies, which would mean replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources (RES) as well as the electrification of transport and heating as a means to tackle global warming and dangerous climate change, would lead to a surge in electricity consumption worldwide. Hence, it appears reasonable that the electric power sector should embed the principles of sustainable development into its functioning and operation. In addition, events such as the recent European gas crisis that have emerged as a result of the massive deployment of renewables need to be studied and prevented. This review aims at assessing the role of the renewable energy in the sustainable development of the electrical power sector, focusing on the energy providers and consumers represented both by businesses and households that are gradually becoming prosumers on the market of electric energy. Furthermore, it also focuses on the impact of renewables on the utility side and their benefits for the grid. In addition, it identifies the major factors of the sustainable development of the electrical power sector.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Wind power, solar power and water power are technologies that can be used as the main sources of renewable energy so that the target of decarbonisation in the energy sector can be achieved. However, when compared with conventional power plants, they have a significant difference. The share of renewable energy has made a difference and posed various challenges, especially in the power generation system. The reliability of the power system can achieve the decarbonization target but this objective often collides with several challenges and failures, such that they make achievement of the target very vulnerable, Even so, the challenges and technological solutions are still very rarely discussed in the literature. This study carried out specific investigations on various technological solutions and challenges, especially in the power system domain. The results of the review of the solution matrix and the interrelated technological challenges are the most important parts to be developed in the future. Developing a matrix with various renewable technology solutions can help solve RE challenges. The potential of the developed technological solutions is expected to be able to help and prioritize them especially cost-effective energy. In addition, technology solutions that are identified in groups can help reduce certain challenges. The categories developed in this study are used to assist in determining the specific needs and increasing transparency of the renewable energy integration process in the future.",

    "abstract": "Solid waste management (SWM) is one of the key responsibilities of city administrators and one of the effective proxies for good governance. Effective SWM mitigates adverse health and environmental impacts, conserves resources, and improves the livability of cities. However, unsustainable SWM practices, exacerbated by rapid urbanization and financial and institutional limitations, negatively impact public health and environmental sustainability. This review article assesses the human and environmental health impacts of SWM practices in the Global South cities that are the future of global urbanization. The study employs desktop research methodology based on in-depth analysis of secondary data and literature, including official documents and published articles. It finds that the commonplace SWM practices include mixing household and commercial garbage with hazardous waste during storage and handling. While waste storage is largely in old or poorly managed facilities such as storage containers, the transportation system is often deficient and informal. The disposal methods are predominantly via uncontrolled dumping, open-air incinerators, and landfills. The negative impacts of such practices include air and water pollution, land degradation, emissions of methane and hazardous leachate, and climate change. These impacts impose significant environmental and public health costs on residents with marginalized social groups mostly affected. The paper concludes with recommendations for mitigating the public and environmental health risks associated with the existing SWM practices in the Global South.",

The technology built in the village managed by the community. Community preparation in technical and non-technical is needed, thus the renewable energy system can provide electricity for a long time. The Green School is a place for the community to learn from each other and discuss about the renewable energy system in their village. The Green School is designed to have three curricula consisting of Basic Training, Intermediate Training and Advanced Training. The training should consist of participants from various background, education and also notice on gender perspective. Basic training’s main goal is making participants braver to express their opinions in front of the forum. The material is about their daily problem. Intermediate Training’s goal is increasing capacity building of community on managing renewable energy technology, e.g. how to handle the problem. Advanced Training’s goal is networking with outside parties to get more ideas and experiences thus community ready to collaborate in managing technology.",

    "abstract": "Agriculture is the backbone of the Ethiopian economy, and the agricultural sector is dominated by smallholder farming systems. The farming systems are facing constraints such as small land size, lack of resources, and increasing degradation of soil quality that hamper sustainable crop production and food security. The effects of climate change (e.g., frequent occurrence of extreme weather events) exacerbate these problems. Applying appropriate technologies like climate-smart agriculture (CSA) can help to resolve the constraints of smallholder farming systems. This paper provides a comprehensive overview regarding opportunities and challenges of traditional and newly developed CSA practices in Ethiopia, such as integrated soil fertility management, water harvesting, and agroforestry. These practices are commonly related to drought resilience, stability of crop yields, carbon sequestration, greenhouse gas mitigation, and higher household income. However, the adoption of the practices by smallholder farmers is often limited, mainly due to shortage of cropland, land tenure issues, lack of adequate knowledge about CSA, slow return on investments, and insufficient policy and implementation schemes. It is suggested that additional measures be developed and made available to help CSA practices become more prevalent in smallholder farming systems. The measures should include the utilization of degraded and marginal lands, improvement of the soil organic matter management, provision of capacity-building opportunities and financial support, as well as the development of specific policies for smallholder farming.",

Motivated by the global reliance on non-renewable energy sources, this research aims to offer a sustainable and autonomous energy solution for rural households. The methodology includes detailed energy load auditing, component selection, and system performance simulation using PVSyst software. The system is configured to supply 3.5 kWh of energy per day, utilizing twelve 100 Wp monocrystalline solar panels, a 45 A MPPT charge controller, a 2000 W inverter, and six 52 Ah lithium-ion batteries, ensuring operation for up to three days without additional power input. Simulation results indicate a performance ratio of 58% and a solar fraction of 1:1, confirming the system’s capability to operate independently from the national grid. The proposed configuration demonstrates the technical and practical feasibility of residential solar electrification in rural Indonesian settings. This study offers a fully autonomous home solar solution based on actual energy usage data and site-specific solar information, unlike previous research that focused on large-scale or hybrid systems, providing a scalable model for expanding energy access in off-grid areas.",

Due to the huge population and current progress in industrialization, these sources are not fulfilling the existing energy needs of the country. Meanwhile, they have adverse environmental impacts and are economically unsuitable to electrify remote areas. Consequently, there is a need to look for alternate energy sources. The aim of this paper is to find out the best renewable energy option for Pakistan. For this purpose, we have collected data for solar radiation and wind speed for a period of one year in four major cities of Pakistan. Results indicate that solar energy is the best renewable energy option for Pakistan in terms of price, life span, operation and maintenance cost. Key barriers have been identified over the whole solar energy spectrum through semi-structured interviews with industry professionals. And finally, important policy recommendations have been proposed for institutions and government to overcome these barriers and utilize maximum solar energy in the country.",

    "abstract": "This review focuses on how culture can complicate attempts at promoting more efficient, more sustainable, and often more affordable forms of mobility as well as energy use in homes and buildings. In simpler terms: it illustrates the cultural barriers to a low-carbon, low-energy future across 28 countries. Rather than focus on energy supply, it deals intently with energy end-use, demand, and consumption. In terms of low-carbon transport and mobility, it examines the cultural barriers to aggressive driving, speeding, and eco-driving; automated vehicles; and ridesharing and carpooling. In terms of cooking and building energy use, it examines the cultural barriers to solar home systems, improved cookstoves, and energy efficient heating. For each case, the review synthesizes a wide range of studies showing that culture can operate as a salient but often unacknowledged barrier to low-carbon transitions as well as sustainability transitions more generally. The paper concludes with recommendations aimed at catalyzing the effectiveness and efficiency with which policymakers, researchers and practitioners are able to research, develop, demonstrate and deploy technologies and policies for a low-carbon transition.",

    ],
    "abstract": "The debate about global environmental decline has been dominated by the wide-ranging harm expected from future climate change. Far less discussed, but equally dangerous, is the accelerating decline of the natural world. The over-exploitation of soils and seas, the cutting of forests and the pollution of air and water are together devastating the living world, according to a massive new UN-sponsored report from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). The full, 1,500-page report will be published later in 2019 but this summary for policy makers has just been released. The four sections of the summary cover the decline in biodiversity and ecosystem services, the accelerating drivers of this change, the failure to meet many of the goals set for conservation and the very challenging actions needed to restore sustainability. The report's most alarming findings have been widely reported. Of an estimated 8 million animal and plant species (75 percent of which are insects), around 1 million are threatened with extinction—more than ever before in human history. Over 40 percent of amphibian species, almost 33 percent of corals, and more than a third of all marine mammals are threatened. At least 680 vertebrate species have been driven to extinction. All this is largely the result of human actions. Three-quarters of the land-based environment and about 66 percent of the marine environment have been significantly altered by man. More than a third of the world's land surface and nearly 75 percent of freshwater resources are now devoted to crop or livestock production. A third of marine fish stocks are being harvested at unsustainable levels. In sum, the biosphere is being altered at an unprecedented scale and pace. The dominant driver of these adverse trends is humanity's rapidly growing need for food, energy, water, and materials. The value of agricultural crops has increased by 300 percent since 1970, raw timber harvest has risen by 45 percent and approximately 60 billion tons of renewable and nonrenewable resources are now extracted globally every year—twice the level estimated for 1980. Land degradation has reduced the productivity of 23 percent of the global land surface. Climate change will accelerate many of these adverse effects over coming decades. The summary concludes with an enumeration of dozens of actions that can be taken by governments, researchers, and individuals, such as practicing informed government, improving documentation of nature, promoting sustainable agricultural practices, and reducing food waste. The report is authoritative and rich in scientific content based on meticulous research conducted by hundreds of scientists. But the text is also densely written, and its major sections consist largely of dozens of separate numbered paragraphs with only a weak overall story line. Readers of PDR may well be disappointed that the role population growth (which is clearly one of the most important indirect drivers of the loss of nature) is barely mentioned and the long list of proposed remedial actions does not mention population policies at all.",

    "abstract": "The agricultural industry is getting more data-centric and requires precise, more advanced data and technologies than before, despite being familiar with agricultural processes. The agriculture industry is being advanced by various information and advanced communication technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT). The rapid emergence of these advanced technologies has restructured almost all other industries, as well as advanced agriculture, which has shifted the industry from a statistical approach to a quantitative one. This radical change has shaken existing farming techniques and produced the latest prospects in a series of challenges. This comprehensive review article enlightens the potential of the IoT in the advancement of agriculture and the challenges faced when combining these advanced technologies with conventional agricultural systems. A brief analysis of these advanced technologies with sensors is presented in advanced agricultural applications. Numerous sensors that can be implemented for specific agricultural practices require best management practices (e.g., land preparation, irrigation systems, insect, and disease management). This review includes the integration of all suitable techniques, from sowing to harvesting, packaging, transportation, and advanced technologies available for farmers throughout the cropping system. Besides, this review article highlights the utilization of other tools such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for crop monitoring and other beneficiary measures, such as optimizing crop yields. In addition, advanced programs based on the IoT are also discussed. Finally, based on our comprehensive review, we identified advanced prospects regarding the IoT, which are essential tools for sustainable agriculture.",

Climate change has been perceived as a \"threat multiplier,\" directly aggravating human security risks, such as food and water insecurity, as well as indirectly contributing to (violent) conflict in regions vulnerable to climate change. In addition to climate change–related environmental risks, such as droughts and floods, land and land use can be affected by climate mitigation and adaptation measures. These include, for instance, large-scale renewable energy plants and relocation efforts. It is not only important for decision-makers to take climate change impacts into account but also to assess the indirect risks associated with climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. For further research, it is hence promising to explore how conflict-sensitive approaches to climate change adaptation and mitigation can be developed.",

    "abstract": "Rural areas are exposed to severe environmental pollution issues fed by industrial and agricultural activities combined with poor waste and sanitation management practices, struggling to achieve the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in line with Agenda 2030. Rural communities are examined through a “dual approach” as both contributors and receivers of plastic pollution leakage into the natural environment (through the air–water–soil–biota nexus). Despite the emerging trend of plastic pollution research, in this paper, we identify few studies investigating rural communities. Therefore, proxy analysis of peer-reviewed literature is required to outline the significant gaps related to plastic pollution and plastic waste management issues in rural regions. This work focuses on key stages such as (i) plastic pollution effects on rural communities, (ii) plastic pollution generated by rural communities, (iii) the development of a rural waste management sector in low- and middle-income countries in line with the SDGs, and (iv) circular economy opportunities to reduce plastic pollution in rural areas. We conclude that rural communities must be involved in both future plastic pollution and circular economy research to help decision makers reduce environmental and public health threats, and to catalyze circular initiatives in rural areas around the world, including less developed communities.",

    "abstract": "Local and indigenous knowledge is being transformed globally, particularly being eroded when pertaining to ecology. In many parts of the world, rural and indigenous communities are facing tremendous cultural, economic and environmental changes, which contribute to weaken their local knowledge base. In the face of profound and ongoing environmental changes, both cultural and biological diversity are likely to be severely impacted as well as local resilience capacities from this loss. In this global literature review, we analyse the drivers of various types of local and indigenous ecological knowledge transformation and assess the directionality of the reported change. Results of this analysis show a global impoverishment of local and indigenous knowledge with 77% of papers reporting the loss of knowledge driven by globalization, modernization, and market integration. The recording of this loss, however, is not symmetrical, with losses being recorded more strongly in medicinal and ethnobotanical knowledge. Persistence of knowledge (15% of the studies) occurred in studies where traditional practices were being maintained consiously and where hybrid knowledge was being produced as a resut of certain types of incentives created by economic development. This review provides some insights into local and indigenous ecological knowledge change, its causes and implications, and recommends venues for the development of replicable and comparative research. The larger implication of these results is that because of the interconnection between cultural and biological diversity, the loss of local and indigenous knowledge is likely to critically threaten effective conservation of biodiversity, particularly in community-based conservation local efforts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Community-scale solar water-pumping systems (SWPSs) have become ideal alternatives for remote villages that lack electricity and water access. In Indonesia, SWPSs have been installed in many villages, but they often malfunction. Although technical studies are available, evidence showing the effect of post-construction support on the interplay in SWPS projects is scarce. Therefore, this study examined the post-construction support from the perspectives of the communities and local actors in four SWPS projects in rural Indonesia using a questionnaire survey. Three types of support were considered in the research framework and selected as dependent variables for regression analysis: capacity building, financial assistance, and technical assistance. Data were collected from 275 beneficiaries and 11 local actors, including local governments and implementing organizations, and statistical analysis was conducted. The results showed that, on average, the communities perceived that the community-based organization (CBO)–a local team that manages SWPS projects–was incapable of solving problems independently. Moreover, the existing support was inadequate and did not meet the requirements of the communities. This study found three determinants of the need for support: technical skills, funds for technical assistance, and financial management (eigenvalues of 2.89, 1.51, and 1.23, respectively). Logistic regression analysis revealed that technical skills were particularly crucial because this factor significantly determined the need for all types of support ( p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.01). However, relying on the support of local actors is difficult, because of their limited resource availability. These findings highlight the significance and role of the support aspect in achieving the sustainability of renewable energy projects in rural areas. Although increased effort to improve the capabilities of the CBOs is necessary, future projects must also consider the trade-off between renewable energy technology and the consequent need for support. Accordingly, designing projects that promote support from all stakeholders is imperative.",

    "abstract": "Access to modern energy is essential for socioeconomic development, yet Africa faces significant challenges in this regard. For example, Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is marked by economic underdevelopment and poverty largely due to the non-environmentally friendly energy used (wood, charcoal) and limited access to modern energy resources. Indeed, this review provides an overview of the African energy landscape; it provides a comprehensive renewables-focused energy pathway for developing a cleaner and more sustainable African energy system. It explores end-use sector electrification in both rural and urban areas in Africa. It emphasizes the rapid expansion of renewable generation, the challenges facing and solutions for the implementation of renewable energy, and the role of emerging technologies. It also presents technological pathways and investment opportunities that will enrich the regional debate and help accelerate the energy transformation across Africa. The analysis demonstrated that the current trends of renewable energy used are hydropower, wind power, biomass, and geothermal energy. The electrification rate in West Africa is less than 58% in urban areas and less than 25% in rural areas. Results show that 65% of the SSA population does not have access to electricity and 81% rely on wood and charcoal. In West Africa, only Ghana (70% or so) and Cape Verde (95.9% or so) have equitable access to electricity between rural and urban areas. The potentiality of solar irradiance in Africa ranges between 3 and 7 KWh/m2/day. The wind speed ranges from 3 m/s to 10 m/s; the wave power can range from 7 to 25 kW/m per site in island regions. Egypt, Morocco, Ethiopia, Tunisia, and South Africa are, respectively, countries leading in wind power technology, and solar energy technology was more advanced in North Africa and South Africa. Finally, geothermal is only developed in Kenya and Tanzania and Kenya is the leader in that field. Although renewable energy in Africa is still growing year to year, it still faces power outages because most renewable energy potentialities are not yet exploited, the technologies used are weak, there is insufficient funding, there is ineffective infrastructure, and there are inadequate or no policies in that field.",

This study adds to the scarce literature on valuing the welfare loss to households in developing countries from energy poverty in terms of access only to intermittent or unreliable electricity networks. We conducted a Contingent Valuation (CV) survey of households in both urban (city of Mekelle) and rural areas (village of Ashegoda) in Northern Ethiopia to estimate households' willingness-to-pay (WTP) to avoid electricity blackouts. On average, the households experienced 160 blackouts per year with an average duration of four hours; and were on average willing to pay 499 Ethiopian birr (18 USD) per household per year. This corresponds to a 34% increase in their annual electricity bill and represents 1% of their mean annual income. Thus, this type of energy poverty represents significant welfare losses in developing countries. The households´ WTP to avoid blackouts increases significantly both with annual income and expenditure as a proxy for income; and with the annual number of experienced blackouts, the average length of these blackouts, and the number of damage categories experienced. These results are all as expected and support the validity and reliability of CV surveys to assess household welfare loss from this type of energy poverty in a developing country context.",

In this work, Al-Tafilah in Jordan was considered as a case study, where the technical, economic, and environmental benefits of a decentralized hybrid renewable energy system that can match 100% of the city demand were investigated. A tri-hybrid system of wind, solar, and hydropower was integrated with an energy storage system and optimized to maximize the match between the energy demand and production profiles. The optimization aimed at maximizing the renewable energy system (RES) fraction while keeping the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) equal to the electricity purchase tariff. The techno-economic analysis showed that the optimal system in Al-Tafilah comprises a 28 MW wind system, 75.4 MW PV, and 1 MW hydropower, with a 259 MWh energy storage system, for which a RES fraction of 99% can be achieved, and 47,160 MtCO2 are avoided yearly. This study can be easily extended to other rural cities in Jordan, as they have higher renewable energy system (RES) potential. The presented findings are essential not only for Jordan’s planning and economy-boosting but also for contributing to the ongoing force against climate change.",

Political and development economists have mainly attributed this disparity in infrastructure distribution to governance. The literature has sufficiently discussed the role that rural-urban infrastructure inequality plays in development outcomes such as poverty. However, not much is known about the effect of the rural-urban infrastructure gap on the environment. To contribute to knowledge and policy discussions, we investigate the impact of rural-urban energy access (in)equality on environmental degradation and the role governance plays using data from 47 sub-Saharan African countries from 2000–2020. Evidence from the heteroskedasticity-based instrumental variable regression consistent with Driscoll and Kraay's estimation revealed that bridging rural-urban energy access inequality is associated with reduction in environmental degradation. We also documented that the direct effect of the governance-related variables used is mixed. The moderation and marginal effect estimates showed that improving governance quality conditions equality in rural-urban energy access to reduce environmental degradation. From a policy perspective, these findings suggest that the implementation of rural electrification policies supported by a good governance system would play a crucial role in mitigating environmental degradation in developing countries.",

    "abstract": "Regional disparity and energy poverty are major challenges for India on a macro-scale. In this study we explored regional disparity and energy poverty in India's future by formulating a series of unique mathematical functions while analyzing historical time-series of per-capita energy consumption (PEC). The functions formulated have important implications on India's approaches towards rapid urbanization, access to clean energy, and rural electrification. We also analyzed end-use energy consumption in low, mid and high-developing states and examined the impacts of the uncertainty of socio-economic changes. As per our estimates, energy consumption in urban areas, is likely to grow by 3.6 times from 2010 to 2070, whereas that in rural areas is likely to decrease by 0.6 times. Energy poverty among Indian states narrows by 2050, while energy consumption in the mid and high-developing states rises rapidly as urbanization and per-capita income increase. Even with this consumption growth, India's average household PEC in 2070 may remain lower than the world average recorded in 2010. The provision of advanced energy resources and technologies is therefore likely to be an important policy challenge for India, especially in the rural areas of low-developing states, as the country pursues its target of reducing energy poverty and regional disparity.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Energy poverty is a global phenomenon, but its prevalence is enormous in most African countries, with a potential impact on quality of life. This study aims to investigate the impact of energy poverty on the shadow economy. Design/methodology/approach The study uses panel data from 45 countries in Africa over a period of 1996–2018. Using panel cointegrating regression and panel vector auto-regression model in the generalized method of moments technique. Findings This study provides that energy poverty deepens the size of the shadow economy in Africa. It also documents that there is a bidirectional causality between shadow economy and energy poverty. Therefore, the two variables can predict each other. Practical implications The study suggests that lack of access to clean and modern energy services contributes to the depth of the shadow economy in Africa. African authorities are advised to strengthen rural and urban electrification initiatives by providing adequate energy infrastructure so as to reduce the level of energy poverty in the region. To ensure energy sustainability delivery, the study proposes that the creation of national and local capacities would be the most effective manner to guarantee energy accessibility and affordability. Also, priorities should be given to the local capital mobilization and energy subsidies for the energy poor. Energy literacy may also contribute to the sustainability and the usage of modern energy sources in Africa. Originality/value Previous studies reveal that income inequality contributes to the large size of shadow economy in developing economies. However, none of these studies analyzed the role of energy poverty and its implications for underground economic operations. Inadequate access to modern energy sources is likely to deepen the prevalence of informality in developing nations. Based on this, this study provides fresh evidence on the implications of energy deprivation on the shadow economy in Africa using a heterogeneous panel econometric framework. The study contributes to the literature by advocating that the provision of affordable modern energy sources for rural and urban settlements, and the creation of good energy infrastructure for the firms in the formal economy would not only improve the quality of life but also important to discourage underground economic operations in developing economies.",

    "abstract": "The greatest sustainability challenge facing humanity today is the greenhouse gas emissions and the global climate change with fossil fuels led by coal, natural gas and oil contributing 61.3% of global electricity generation in the year 2020. The cumulative effect of the Stockholm, Rio, and Johannesburg conferences identified sustainable energy development (SED) as a very important factor in the sustainable global development. This study reviews energy transition strategies and proposes a roadmap for sustainable energy transition for sustainable electricity generation and supply in line with commitments of the Paris Agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and limiting the rise in global average temperature to 1.5°C above the preindustrial level. The sustainable transition strategies typically consist of three major technological changes namely, energy savings on the demand side, generation efficiency at production level and fossil fuel substitution by various renewable energy sources and low carbon nuclear. For the transition remain technically and economically feasible and beneficial, policy initiatives are necessary to steer the global electricity transition towards a sustainable energy and electricity system. Large-scale renewable energy adoption should include measures to improve efficiency of existing nonrenewable sources which still have an important cost reduction and stabilization role. A resilient grid with advanced energy storage for storage and absorption of variable renewables should also be part of the transition strategies. From this study, it was noted that whereas sustainable development has social, economic, and environmental pillars, energy sustainability is best analysed by five-dimensional approach consisting of environmental, economic, social, technical, and institutional/political sustainability to determine resource sustainability. The energy transition requires new technology for maximum use of the abundant but intermittent renewable sources a sustainable mix with limited nonrenewable sources optimized to minimize cost and environmental impact but maintained quality, stability, and flexibility of an electricity supply system. Technologies needed for the transition are those that use conventional mitigation, negative emissions technologies which capture and sequester carbon emissions and finally technologies which alter the global atmospheric radiative energy budget to stabilize and reduce global average temperature. A sustainable electricity system needs facilitating technology, policy, strategies and infrastructure like smart grids, and models with an appropriate mix of both renewable and low carbon energy sources.",

    "abstract": "Energy poverty or lack of access to electricity is still a pressing development challenge worldwide particularly in archipelagic countries like the Philippines and Indonesia. As rural electrification in these remote areas through on-grid extension becomes costly, these communities typically resort to diesel-powered off-grid generators, characterized by high operating costs, unstable supply and price of fuel, and environmental issues. The deployment of clean energy alternatives is clearly needed, but these must be selected systematically using multiple but possibly conflicting criteria. Currently, the decision on which technology to use is derived based on the levelized cost of electricity primarily. In this illustrative case study, a novel multi-criteria decision-making methodology is proposed for the selection of the most appropriate energy system for the off-grid electrification of Marinduque Island. Eight technology combination options were evaluated using six criteria covering socio-economic, environmental, and technical aspects. Fuzzy AHP was used to derive weights of the criteria while addressing ambiguity and subjectivity of decision-makers. Performances of the technology options across different criteria were determined quantitatively via techno-economic simulations, or qualitatively via domain expert estimates. Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) was then used to aggregate the entire range of performance attributes of each alternative into a single score. Results indicate that system reliability and social acceptability are the most important criteria in selecting hybrid energy systems for off-grid electrification. Among the eight alternatives, the fuel saver (diesel-solar PV hybrid) and diesel-solar PV-Li-ion hybrid systems yield the highest performance scores. The prioritization was mainly affected by system reliability and social acceptability, indicating that decision making for the attainment of sustainable island energy supply should not be limited to technical and economic considerations only. This is consistent with the current worldwide trend of implementing the diesel-solar PV-Li-ion hybrid systems in off-grid areas, thus, validating the applicability of the facile methodology developed in this work.",

    "abstract": "Rural energy in all their dimensions, not only access, but also sources, supply, consumption, program management, project maintenance, control and evaluation has been a neglected area in national energy planning in developing countries. As a result, nearly two billion people all around the world lack access to commercial energy, particularly to electricity and clean cooking appliances. Poor people still depend on traditional sources of energy that are used inefficiently. The unplanned exploitation of local biomass resources, mainly for basic needs such as cooking, generates serious environmental problems. In this sense, women face hardship in the collection of biomass and exposure to smoke that adversely affect their health. Therefore, this study aims to explore rural energy policies through a systematic literature review about rural energy access as a problem to be solved by means of an adequate rural energy policy. The study tries to raise the general settings of rural energy access, their challenges, barriers, and alternatives for solution, especially through the consideration of rural energy policy as an alternative to achieve a sustainable solution for rural poverty. Besides, by organizing and collecting concepts, this review contributes to a better understanding of these topics and their general issues, particularly in Latin America. Considering the general context as an initial condition, and the universal energy access as the perfect condition, rural energy policy becomes the central strategy to ensure universal energy access in all rural areas, trying to transit from an initial to a perfect condition.Keywords: Rural energy policy, Rural energy access, Rural energy poverty, Rural electrification, Clean cooking alternatives.JEL Classifications: Q40, Q43, Q48, Q49, R10, R58DOI: https://doi.org/10.32479/ijeep.11268",

The goal of this paper is to provide insights to development practitioners on designing interventions to maximize the development impact of infrastructure. For this, the paper presents a systematic qualitative overview of the literature, covering more than 300 studies conducted between 1983 and 2022, focusing on specific infrastructure sectors, namely digital, energy, and transport. The study also considers various dimensions of development impact, including output and productivity, poverty and inequality, labor market outcomes, human capital formation, and trade, to develop a nuanced understanding of the mechanisms through which infrastructure contributes to these development outcomes, focusing on low- and middle-income countries. As such, it is the most substantive effort of its kind to date. Overall, despite some mixed results, the overwhelming balance of evidence suggests that infrastructure improvements are critical in supporting the development process. Studies on digital infrastructure show that firm productivity, employment, and welfare increase with the arrival of broadband internet coverage. In addition, the availability of mobile phones improves coordination between producers and traders and hence reduces the price dispersion of agricultural products. Turning to rural electrification, significant literature documents the positive impact of infrastructure on household welfare, structural transformation, and human capital formation through increased labor force participation, more time spent on education, and increased indoor air quality. Investments in the reliability of power supply also contribute to firms' productivity. However, studies based on randomized controlled trials have not tended to find a substantial short-term impact in the context of dispersed rural populations. Finally, there is rich literature on various transport infrastructure-to-development linkages, particularly for rural roads and for Sub-Saharan Africa. While households' income and consumption benefit from the existence of rural roads, highways are also found to contribute to firms' competitiveness. Similarly, public transportation, railways, and ports have positive impacts on the development process.

At the same time, Poland remains the economy most dependent on coal and one of the largest air polluters in the EU. In order to minimize this problem and to meet the direction of energy development in the EU, Poland decided to establish, among other things, an energy cooperative. It is intended to fill the gap in the development of the civil dimension of energy on a local scale and at the same time improve efficiency in the use of the potential of renewable energy sources in rural areas. The authors of the paper seek to verify the extent to which this new institution, which is part of the idea of a local energy community, one of the driving forces for the implementation of the objectives and directions of development of “clean energy” set by the EU, has a chance to develop. The research took into account the characteristics of energy producers and consumers in rural areas, economic preferences provided for by law, relating to the functioning of an energy cooperative and the existing alternative solutions dedicated to prosumers. A dedicated mathematical model in the mixed integer programming technology was used to optimize the functioning of an energy cooperative, and more than 5000 simulations were carried out, with a typical optimization task performed as part of the research with about 50,000 variables. The conclusions and simulations make it possible to confirm the thesis that profitable energy cooperatives can be established in rural areas, with the objective of minimizing the sum of energy purchases from the distribution network and losses on the energy deposit (virtual network storage) (the energy deposit (or network deposit) should be understood as energy introduced to the grid during generation surpluses for its subsequent consumption, taking into account the discount factor).",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Off-grid and decentralized energy systems have emerged as an alternative to facilitate energy access and resilience in a flexible, adaptable way, particularly for communities that do not have reliable access to centralized energy networks both in rural and urban areas. Much research to date on community energy systems has focused on their deployment in Europe and North America. This paper advances these debates by looking at how community energy systems can support energy transitions in Africa. Specifically, it asks: what role can community energy systems play in the energy transition in East and Southern Africa? Results This article investigates the potential for community energy to foster sustainable and just energy transitions in two countries in East and Southern Africa, namely Ethiopia and Mozambique. To do so, it explores transformations in Ethiopia and Mozambique’s energy systems through the lens of energy landscapes. This concept enables us to situate energy transitions within recent developments in energy governance and to understand current and future possibilities for change through the involvement of communities that currently lack access to reliable and clean energy. Our results show that when countries face the prospects of lucrative energy investments in natural gas or large hydropower, renewables are often deprioritized. Their suitability to address energy challenges and access gaps is de-emphasized, even though there is little evidence that investment in large-scale generation can handle the energy needs of the most disadvantaged groups. Initiatives and policies supporting community-focused renewable energy have remained limited in both countries. They tend to be designed from the top-down and focused on rural areas when they exist. Conclusions Energy transitions in Ethiopia and Mozambique, and many other countries with significant gaps in access to centralized energy systems, require putting inclusivity at the forefront to ensure that energy policies and infrastructure support the well-being of society as a whole. As long as investments in off-grid energy continue to depend on international organizations’ goodwill or development aid programs outside the ambit of national energy plans, energy access gaps will remain unaddressed, and there will not be a genuine and just transition to sustainable energy.",

    "abstract": "Microgrids operating on renewable energy resources have potential for powering rural areas located far from existing grid infrastructures. These small power systems typically host a hybrid energy system of diverse architecture and size. An effective integration of renewable energies resources requires careful design. Sizing methodologies often lack the consideration for reliability and this aspect is limited to power adequacy. There exists an inherent trade-off between renewable integration, cost, and reliability. To bridge this gap, a sizing methodology has been developed to perform multi-objective optimization, considering the three design objectives mentioned above. This method is based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) that returns the set of optimal solutions under all objectives. This method aims to identify the trade-offs between renewable integration, reliability, and cost allowing to choose the adequate architecture and sizing accordingly. As a case study, we consider an autonomous microgrid, currently being installed in a rural area in Mali. The results show that increasing system reliability can be done at the least cost if carried out in the initial design stage.",

    "abstract": "To avert climate change, there has been a rise in the usage of green energy sources that are also beneficial to the environment. To generate sustainable energy in a financially and technically efficient manner, our research attempts to close the gaps. The potential of green sources like photovoltaic (PV) and biomass for a rural community southwest of Sohag Al Gadida City, Sohag, Egypt, is examined in this research considering its techno-economic (TE) and eco-friendly feasibility. The HOMER Pro v3.14 package is used as a scaling and optimization instrument, to calculate the price of the PV/biomass setup and the size and characteristics of its parts. This is to estimate the corresponding electrical production and reduce the total annual cost for the customer. The suggested system structure is validated through the presentation of simulation outcomes and evaluations utilizing MATLAB/SIMULINK R2022a. In addition, a TE-environmental investigation of the optimized PV/biomass structure is performed. The optimum structure is carefully chosen from the best four configurations using the demand predilection by analogy to the perfect technique based on the generation cost, operation cost, energy production, and renewable fraction. The results also indicate that using hybrid PV/biomass is an attractive choice with the initial capital cost (ICC: USD 8.144), net present cost (NPC: USD 11,026), a low cost of energy (LCOE: 0.184 USD/kWh), and the high renewable fraction (RF: 99.9%) of the system. The annual CO2 emission performance of a PV/biomass system is much better than that of the grid alone and PV/diesel. This method might be applied in rural areas in other developing countries.",

    "abstract": "The European Green Deal aims to make Europe the world’s first climate-neutral continent by 2050 by shifting to a clean circular economy, combating biodiversity loss and reducing pollution levels. In Poland, whose economy invariably remains one of the most dependent on coal consumption in Europe, institutional responses to the above EU objectives have taken the shape of energy cooperatives aimed at filling the gaps in the development of the civic dimension of energy on a local scale and the use of potential renewable energy sources in rural areas, including in relation to the agricultural sector. This article is a continuation of the authors’ previous research work, which has so far focused on the analysis of the development of profitability of Polish institutions that fit into the European idea of a “local energy community”, which includes energy cooperatives. In this research paper, they present the results of subsequent research work and analyses performed on the basis of it which, on the one hand, complement the previously developed optimization model with variables concerning actual energy storage and, on the other hand, analyze the profitability of the operation of energy cooperatives in the conditions of the “capacity market”. The latter was actually introduced in Poland at the beginning of 2021. The research took account of the characteristics of energy producers and consumers in rural areas of Poland, the legally defined rules for the operation of the capacity market and the institutional conditions for the operation of energy cooperatives that can use the potential of energy storage. A dedicated mathematical model in mixed integer programming technology was used, enriched with respect to previous research, making it possible to optimize the operation of energy cooperative with the use of actual energy storage (batteries). Conclusions from the research and simulation show that the installation of energy storage only partially minimizes the volume of energy drawn from the grid in periods when fees related to the capacity market are in force (which should be avoided due to higher costs for consumers). The analysis also indicates that a key challenge is the proper parameterization of energy storage.",

    "abstract": "Several rural areas in Sarawak do not have access to electricity. In Sarawak, most investigations prioritize conventional sources despite the emergence of technology such as fuel cells. Furthermore, diversified investigations on stand-alone hybrid renewable energy systems in Sarawak are lacking. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating the feasibility of a stand-alone hybrid renewable energy system for rural applications in Sarawak, with a specific focus on the potential benefits of incorporating hydrogen. Different configurations, namely A: Photovoltaic, hydrogen, micro-hydro, B: hydrogen, micro-hydro, C: micro-hydro, D: photovoltaic, and micro-hydro was explored, each with its results, and comparisons were performed between them. By analyzing the system under various load patterns and conducting a sensitivity analysis, the researchers found that scenario A was the most cost-effective and reliable option for a longhouse in Sri Aman, with a net present cost of $148,687, cost of energy of $0.19/kWh, and initial capital of $107,207. Simultaneously, scenario A has the highest annual generating capacity of up to 116521kWh annually. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the electrolyzer could impact the cost of the system. The electrolyzer is the third and second most expensive in scenarios A and B. This research demonstrates the potential of alternative energy sources to improve access to electricity in rural areas. It highlights the importance of continued exploration into emerging technologies to ensure everyone can access safe and reliable electricity.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is a long-lasting change in the weather arrays across tropics to polls. It is a global threat that has embarked on to put stress on various sectors. This study is aimed to conceptually engineer how climate variability is deteriorating the sustainability of diverse sectors worldwide. Specifically, the agricultural sector's vulnerability is a globally concerning scenario, as sufficient production and food supplies are threatened due to irreversible weather fluctuations. In turn, it is challenging the global feeding patterns, particularly in countries with agriculture as an integral part of their economy and total productivity. Climate change has also put the integrity and survival of many species at stake due to shifts in optimum temperature ranges, thereby accelerating biodiversity loss by progressively changing the ecosystem structures. Climate variations increase the likelihood of particular food and waterborne and vector-borne diseases, and a recent example is a coronavirus pandemic. Climate change also accelerates the enigma of antimicrobial resistance, another threat to human health due to the increasing incidence of resistant pathogenic infections. Besides, the global tourism industry is devastated as climate change impacts unfavorable tourism spots. The methodology investigates hypothetical scenarios of climate variability and attempts to describe the quality of evidence to facilitate readers' careful, critical engagement. Secondary data is used to identify sustainability issues such as environmental, social, and economic viability. To better understand the problem, gathered the information in this report from various media outlets, research agencies, policy papers, newspapers, and other sources. This review is a sectorial assessment of climate change mitigation and adaptation approaches worldwide in the aforementioned sectors and the associated economic costs. According to the findings, government involvement is necessary for the country's long-term development through strict accountability of resources and regulations implemented in the past to generate cutting-edge climate policy. Therefore, mitigating the impacts of climate change must be of the utmost importance, and hence, this global threat requires global commitment to address its dreadful implications to ensure global sustenance.",

As the United Nations’ SDG 7 calls for access to electricity for all by 2030, Africa still has a wide gap to fill as the statistics show that 85% of the population that will not have access to electricity is in Africa. As the world tries to wean itself off non-renewable energy and transition to green through use of renewable energy sources, hydropower energy remains at the heart of Africa for this venture. With majority of the rural population in Africa lacking electricity, there is need for a low-tech system that utilizes river flow to generate just enough energy for normal operation in these regions. Micro-hydrokinetic river turbine technology (µ-HRT), which offers less intermittency, can potentially contribute to sustainably electrifying Africa rural areas. The technology has been adopted by few countries worldwide, with limited comprehensive study in Africa even though the technology seems viable for use in African rivers. This paper reviewed the status of the µ-HRT applications in Africa and some of the barriers to its development. The study found out that the technology has not been vastly developed in Africa. Despite numerous barriers, the technology is simply a low-tech technology that requires the use of local resources and capacity building for its sustainability in terms of construction, operation and maintenance requirements. It is therefore recommended that R&amp;D and field trials be conducted for its possible adoption.",

    "abstract": "Rural areas have gained relevance in the EU policy framework as a result of the experienced depopulation trend experienced in these areas. Smart Rural Communities are recognized as effective means to tackle this issue by delivering smart services to local population leading to improved economic competitivity. One of the major challenges, among others, is to deliver renewable energy matching existing demand in opposition of fossil-fuel based solutions. To this end, Energy Communities (EC) potential to deploy Renewable Energies (RE) while improving supplier – consumer engagement and empowering the energy consumer. Despite the advances throughout the EU in the deployment of ECs, the vast majority of them are based on PV systems, leaving a huge path for development of novel business models for thermal energy communities, mainly due to the existing economic and social barriers to thermal energy communities' deployment. The present work aims at contributing to the closure of this research gap by systematizing community-based business model arrangements for thermal energy communities' deployment to then identify the relevance of main affecting parameters and identify the critical success factors for business model success. To do so, a novel multi-dimensional business model framework is proposed to promote the deployment of Thermal Energy Communities based on the use of local biomass with a District Heating (DH) network distribution system. The proposed framework analyses business model viability in terms of economic and environmental benefits for different EC layouts according to spatial configuration of the demand –clustered/urban vs. scattered/rural – and to demand profile – industrial/low seasonality vs. residential/high seasonality. Results show that business models are economically viable in terms of payback period below boiler service life and NPV/IRR of the investment needed for all cases, although best results are obtained for clustered and industrial demand as a result of lower investment requirements to deliver the same amount of energy. Critical success factors to ensure business model viability are also investigated, finding the minimum natural gas tariff that makes economically viable the thermal EC business proposition. Last, the business model incorporates the use of digital tools for biomass traceability and low carbon certification enabling local biomass use and supplier – consumer transparency that promotes greater stakeholder engagement. Also, biomass digital traceability is aligned with current regulatory framework in the EU, namely the Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) and the upcoming revision of it (RED III), making the EC business model up-to-date and competitive in terms of services offered to the end-user.",

The aim of this work is to give a review of the hydrokinetic energy potential of water resources, the requirements and impacts of the implementation of hydrokinetic technology in different countries, and the current development in the Colombian case. At present, it can be observed that the implementation of this technology in different regions of the world, especially in Colombia, has several challenges and barriers, including gaps in knowledge, information and data, such as well as limitations of water resources and infrastructure, finally, impacting on a low adoption of this technology.

Sunlight being a constant source of energy is used to meet the ever-increasing energy need. This review discusses the world's energy needs, renewable energy technologies for domestic use, and highlights public opinions on renewable energy. A systematic review of the literature was conducted from 2009 to 2018. During this process, more than 300 articles were classified and 42 papers were filtered for critical review. The literature analysis showed that despite serious efforts at all levels to reduce reliance on fossil fuels by promoting renewable energy as its alternative, fossil fuels continue to contribute 73.5% to the worldwide electricity production in 2017. Conversely, renewable sources contributed only 26.5%. Furthermore, this study highlights that the lack of public awareness is a major barrier to the acceptance of renewable energy technologies. The results of this study show that worldwide energy crises can be managed by integrating renewable energy sources in the power generation. Moreover, in order to facilitate the development of renewable energy technologies, this systematic review has highlighted the importance of public opinion and performed a real-time analysis of public tweets. This example of tweet analysis is a relatively novel initiative in a review study that will seek to direct the attention of future researchers and policymakers toward public opinion and recommend the implications to both academia and industries. 2013 IEEE.",

We present a new data set of annual historical (1750–2014) anthropogenic chemically reactive gases (CO, CH4, NH3, NOx, SO2, NMVOCs), carbonaceous aerosols (black carbon – BC, and organic carbon – OC), and CO2 developed with the Community Emissions Data System (CEDS). We improve upon existing inventories with a more consistent and reproducible methodology applied to all emission species, updated emission factors, and recent estimates through 2014. The data system relies on existing energy consumption data sets and regional and country-specific inventories to produce trends over recent decades. All emission species are consistently estimated using the same activity data over all time periods. Emissions are provided on an annual basis at the level of country and sector and gridded with monthly seasonality. These estimates are comparable to, but generally slightly higher than, existing global inventories. Emissions over the most recent years are more uncertain, particularly in low- and middle-income regions where country-specific emission inventories are less available. Future work will involve refining and updating these emission estimates, estimating emissions' uncertainty, and publication of the system as open-source software.",

    "abstract": "Development activities and energy access are intertwined; however, they also contribute towards climate change. Therefore, climate friendly activities are needed to be promoted to ensure socio-economic development. Productive use of renewable energy for income generation is an emerging area of development in developing countries and is under-explored; therefore, there is a need to study the impact of such interventions on income generation. In this context, this paper attempts to estimate the impact of a renewable energy based, women managed collective from rural Maharashtra (India) on the income of beneficiaries using interview-based survey design. An analysis of the data indicates a significant change in beneficiaries’ income with associated multiplier effect vis-à-vis non-beneficiaries’, depicting such initiatives have potential to effect socio-economic development while being environment friendly. This is vital as India foresees an important role for renewable energy to address development issues, rural infrastructure gaps, and climate goals.

    "abstract": "The Asia-Pacific region is home to more than half of the global population and accounted for 62·6% of global deaths due to liver diseases in 2015. 54·3% of global deaths due to cirrhosis, 72·7% of global deaths due to hepatocellular carcinoma, and more than two-thirds of the global burden of acute viral hepatitis occurred in this region in 2015. Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection caused more than half of the deaths due to cirrhosis in the region, followed by alcohol consumption (20·8%), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD; 12·1%), and chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV; 15·7%). In 2015, HBV accounted for about half the cases of hepatocellular carcinoma in the region. Preventive strategies for viral hepatitis-related liver disease include increasing access to clean drinking water and sanitation. HBV vaccination programmes for neonates have been implemented by all countries, although birth-dose coverage is extremely suboptimal in some. Availability of screening tests for blood and tissue, donor recall policies, and harm reduction strategies are in their initial stages in most countries. Many governments have put HBV and HCV drugs on their essential medicines lists and the availability of generic versions of these drugs has reduced costs. Efforts to eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat, together with the rapid increase in per-capita alcohol consumption in countries and the epidemic of obesity, are expected to change the spectrum of liver diseases in the Asia-Pacific region in the near future. The increasing burden of alcohol-related liver diseases can be contained through government policies to limit consumption and promote less harmful patterns of alcohol use, which are in place in some countries but need to be enforced more strictly. Steps are needed to control obesity and NAFLD, including policies to promote healthy lifestyles and regulate the food industry. Inadequate infrastructure and insufficient health-care personnel trained in liver diseases are issues that also need to be addressed in the Asia-Pacific region. The policy response of most governments to liver diseases has thus far been inadequate and poorly funded. There must be a renewed focus on prevention, early detection, timely referral, and research into the best means to introduce and improve health interventions to reduce the burden of liver diseases in the Asia-Pacific region.",

    "abstract": "This article reviews recent results on technology adoption in developing countries, primarily from field experiments. It focuses on studies that highlight three constraints to adoption: credit, insurance, and information. Interventions supplying credit are consistently effective in spurring technology adoption for a minority of farmers, while interventions supplying insurance have had more mixed results. This review suggests that one mitigating factor on demand for both of these products is incomplete information, which adds additional uninsurable risk to the technology adoption decision. A broad group of studies identify the presence of strong informational frictions. The review concludes with some potential directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "Indonesia, as an archipelagic nation, has about 150 million people (60%) living in coastal areas. Such communities are increasingly vulnerable to the effects of change, in the form of sea level rise and stronger, more intense storms. Population growth in coastal areas will also increase the disaster risk mainly because of climate change-related effects such as flooding, droughts, and tidal floods. This study examines the dynamic changes of urban population and urban villages in three decadal periods, from 1990, 2000, to 2010. To highlight different disasters that are increasingly tied to climate change, the analysis was conducted in the northern coastal area of Central Java province using village potential (PODES) data, which are routinely collected by the government. Results show that about 41% of people in Central Java province live in the northern coastal region and 50% live in urban areas. The numbers of hazard events within a distance range of 0–40 km from the shoreline are: flooding (non-tidal)—335; tidal flooding—65; and droughts—28. Based on this study, about half of flood disasters (non-tidal) occurred within 10 km of the shoreline, while tidal flooding accounted for 80%. Most of the climate-related disasters were found in rural areas at low levels of population growth, while in urban areas the disasters were found to be associated in less than 1% and in more than 3% of population growth.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes the planning of hybrid micro-hydro and solar photovoltaic system for rural areas of Central Java, Indonesia. The Indonesian government has paid great attention to the development of renewable energy sources, especially solar and hydropower. One area that has a high potential for both types of energy is the province of Central Java, located on the island of Java, Indonesia. In this research, we conduct field research to determine the ideal capacity of solar and micro-hydro hybrid power plants, electricity load analysis, and optimal design of hybrid power plants. Data on the potential of micro-hydro plants are obtained by direct measurement on the Ancol Bligo irrigation channel located in Bligo village, Ngluwar district, Magelang regency, Central Java province, Indonesia. Data on solar power potential were obtained from NASA’s database for solar radiation in the Central Java region. Hydropower potential data include channel length, debit, heads, and power potential in irrigation channels originating from rivers. These data are used to design an optimal hybrid power plant. The method used to obtain the optimal design of a hybrid power plant system is based on the analysis of capital costs, grid sales, cost of energy, and net present cost. Based on the parameters of the analysis, the composition of the optimal generator for the on-grid scheme to the distribution network can be determined. The results showed that hybrid power plants were able to meet the needs of electrical energy in the villages around the power plant and that the excess energy could be sold to national electricity providers.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Blockchain Technology (BCT) is a growing digital technology that in recent years has gained widespread traction in various industries in the public and private sectors. BCT is a decentralized ledger that records every transaction made in the network, known as a ‘block’, the body of which is comprised of encrypted data of the entire transaction history. BCT was introduced as the working mechanism that forms the operational basis of Bitcoin, the first digital cryptocurrency to gain mainstream appeal. The introduction of decentralized data exchange technology in any industry would require strengthened security, enforce accountability, and could potentially accelerate a shift in workflow dynamics from current centralized architectures to a decentralized, cooperative chain of command and affect a cultural and societal change by encouraging trust and transparency. BCT aims at creating a system that would offer a robust self-regulating, self-monitoring, and cyber-resilient data transaction operation, assuring the facilitation and protection of a truly efficient data exchange system. In the state of Florida, climate change and unpredicted weather disasters have put pressure on state and local decision-makers to adapt quick and efficient post-disaster recovery systems. Part of the recovery efforts is the reconstruction of buildings and infrastructure. The introduction of new technologies in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry can contribute to addressing recovery and rebuilding after the event of a natural disaster. With parallel technological advancement in geospatial data and Geographic Information System (GIS), as well as worsening climatic conditions, concerns can be suitably addressed by employing an integrated system of both Building Information Modeling (BIM) and BCT. While several potential applications of BIM must provide solutions to disaster-related issues, few have seen practical applications in recent years that indicate the potential benefits of such implementations. The feasibility of BIM-based applications still rests on the reliability of connectivity and cyber-security, indicating a strong use case for using BCT in conjunction with BIM for post-disaster recovery. This research depicts a survey of BCT and its applications in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industries and examines the potential incorporation within the BIM process to address post-disaster rebuilding problems. Moreover, the study investigates the potential application of BCT in improving the framework for automating the building permitting process using Smart Contract (SC) technologies and Hyperledger Fabric (HLF), as well as discussing future research areas. The study proposes a new conceptualized framework resulting from the integration of BCT and BIM processes to improve the efficiency of building permit processes in post-disaster events.",

    "abstract": "The application of metallic nanoparticles (MNPs), especially that of silver, gold, cobalt, and zinc as antimicrobial, anticancer, drug delivery, contrast, and bioimaging agents has transformed the field of medicine. Their functions, which are attributed to their physicochemical properties, have gained prominence in various technological fields. Although MNPs can be produced via rigorous physical and chemical techniques, in recent years, a biological approach utilizing natural materials has been developed. With the increasing enthusiasm for safe and efficient nanomaterials, the biological method incorporating microorganisms and plants is preferred over physical and chemical methods of nanoparticle synthesis. Of these bio-entities, plants have received great attention owing to their capability to reduce and stabilize MNPs in a single one-pot protocol. South Africa is home to ~10% of the world’s plant species, making it a major contributor to the world’s ecological scenery. Despite the documented contribution of South African plants, particularly in herbal medicine, very few of these plants have been explored for the synthesis of the noble MNPs. This paper provides a review of some important South African medicinal plants that have been utilized for the synthesis of MNPs. The enhanced biological properties of the biogenic MNPs attest to their relevance in medicine. In this endeavour, more of the African plant biodiversity must be explored for the synthesis of MNPs and be validated for their potential to be translated into future nanomedicine.",

    "abstract": "Pigeon pea (PP) [Cajanus cajan (L.) Huth] plays an important role in preserving poor smallholders’ major source of income in the tropics and subtropics by improving food and feed security, particularly protein intake. In the meantime, protein deficiency is frequent in tropical and subtropical regions due to rapidly increasing human populations and the high cost of animal-origin proteins. As a result, pulse crops should be their primary source of protein. Among these, PP is the most important pulse crop utilized as a food component in rain-fed agricultural conditions with the lowest costs, and it is the best source of protein supplements in typical cereal-based diets to fill the nutritional deficit. Despite this, it is the world’s least-used pulse crop. Therefore, the primary goal of this review was to provide and synthesize scientifically confirmed and up-to-date information on the dietary usage of pigeon pea for food and feed. Protein, carbohydrates, minerals, vitamins, and essential amino acids are all present in reasonable amounts in both mature and immature PP seeds. PP has the most potential for usage as food and feed, and its nutrients are comparable to those of soybeans and maize. PP’s green leaves, roots, seeds, and pods are high in phenolic compounds, which have anti-inflammation, antibacterial, antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, and antidiabetic properties, as well as the ability to cure diseases like measles, smallpox, chicken pox, sickle cell anemia, fever, dysentery, hepatitis, and antimalarial medications for the body. Furthermore, the addition of pigeon pea and its by-products improves ruminant and nonruminant animal feeding performance significantly. In general, PP products such as dried grain, fresh (aerial portion), and green pods are used as a low-cost (low-cost) source of high-quality and quantity of protein food and feed for tropical and subtropical populations’ livelihoods.",

In this paper, we have reviewed the literature relating to TEK held by the tribal and other traditional societies of North East India. The region is very rich in TEK pertaining to species, ecosystems, and their interactions including their sustainable management and utilization in forestry, fisheries, agriculture, food, crafts, dye, and health care. Some of these TEK based knowledge systems are at par or even superior to the resource management practices evolved under the ambit of modern knowledge. Though a substantial chunk of TEK of tribal communities of North East India has been documented, huge treasures of such knowledge remain unreported and hence are on the verge of being lost.",

In addition, it must be inclusive. This paper presents transformation pathways toward sustainable rural tourism management in developing countries. The general objective is to develop sustainable development strategies in the context of rural tourism. The specific objectives are to develop policy pathways and the best scenarios in this context. The study was conducted in the Kedung Ombo area in Central Java, Indonesia: a representative area involving several districts and other public organizations as stakeholders. Data analysis was performed using the MULTIPOL method. The results show that an integrated development policy that considers the interests of all stakeholders, the potential of rural resources, the infrastructure, and human resources capacity would be the optimal policy. Priority programs to be implemented are infrastructure development, strengthening private investment, strengthening governance, developing amenities, and developing information and communication technology. Furthermore, the “flight of the flamingos” and “leapfrogging” scenarios can be considered to achieve future tourism growth goals and objectives. This study is an essential resource for authorities in determining rural tourism development policies in the research location and can be applied in other areas with similar characteristics.",

Responsive deployments facilitate dense time-series measurements, unique opportunities for geophysical surveys, sample collection from hostile environments such as volcanic plumes and crater lakes, and emergency deployment of ground-based sensors (and robots) into hazardous regions. UAS have already been used to support hazard management and decision-makers during eruptive crises. As technologies advance, increasing system capabilities, autonomy and availability, supported by more diverse and lighter-weight sensors, will offer unparalleled potential for hazard monitoring.

To understand crop foraging and its value to wildlife or its implications for humans requires a cross-disciplinary approach that considers the behavior and ecology of wild animals engaging in this behavior; the types and levels of competition for resources between people and wildlife; people's perceptions of and attitudes toward wildlife, including animals that forage on crops; and discourse about animals and their behaviors and how these discourses can be used for expressing dissent and distress about other social conflicts. So, to understand and respond to conflicts about crop damage, we need to look beyond what people lose, i.e., crop loss and economic equivalence, and focus more on what people say about wildlife and why they say it.",

Most landslide early warning systems are based on rainfall thresholds defined on the regional scale, regardless of the different landslide susceptibilities of various slopes. Here we divided slope units in southern Taiwan into three categories (high, moderate and low) according to their susceptibility. For each category, we established separate rainfall thresholds so as to provide differentiated thresholds for different degrees of susceptibility. Logistic regression (LR) analysis was performed to evaluate landslide susceptibility by using event-based landslide inventories and predisposing factors. Analysis of rainfall patterns of 941 landslide cases gathered from field investigation led to the recognition that 3 h mean rainfall intensity (I3) is a key rainfall index for rainfall of short duration but high intensity; in contrast, 24 h accumulated rainfall (R24) was recognized as a key rainfall index for rainfall of long duration but low intensity. Thus, the I3–R24 rainfall index was used to establish rainfall thresholds in this study. Finally, an early warning model is proposed by setting alert levels including yellow (advisory), orange (watch) and red (warning) according to a hazard matrix. These differentiated thresholds and alert levels can provide essential information for local governments to use in deciding whether to evacuate residents.",

    "abstract": "Participatory approaches to forest management have been promoted as a means of returning rights historically removed, and as a way of managing natural resources sustainably, fairly, and to improve livelihoods in communities. Top-down models of community-based forest management take the perspective that if people feel ownership over, have a voice in decisions about, and can benefit from surrounding ecosystems, then they will be motivated to maintain and protect them. However, even participatory approaches, such as community-based forest management, may not always result in clear positive outcomes for involvement in decision making and forest conservation. We examine whether an Indonesian government initiative for community-based forest management was positively associated with community members' participation in local decision making and support for conservation and sustainable management of forest resources, in the context of state-owned lands. We used household questionnaire data to compare villages with and without a community forest, and community forests over time in a case study region of West Kalimantan. Analyzing forest visitations, conservation support, and indicators of procedural equity, we found no consistent association between having a community forest and higher levels of participation in decision making or household support for forest conservation. However, well-being indicators were positively associated with more active participation. The level of support for forest conservation was also positively related to households' leadership in village institutions and higher levels of well-being, particularly subjective well-being, land tenure, and material wealth. These social-demographic factors are important considerations when designing and implementing community-based forest management, which strives for fair and just decision-making processes along with forest conservation. The findings highlight how existing socioeconomic contexts factor into local institutions, and that accounting for these in program design and implementation may help address existing social inequalities that influence achieving joint social and ecological objectives.",

However, an updated and comprehensive assessment of the global burden attributable to SSBs remains scarce. Here we estimated SSB-attributable T2D and CVD burdens across 184 countries in 1990 and 2020 globally, regionally and nationally, incorporating data from the Global Dietary Database, jointly stratified by age, sex, educational attainment and urbanicity. In 2020, 2.2 million (95% uncertainty interval 2.0–2.3) new T2D cases and 1.2 million (95% uncertainty interval 1.1–1.3) new CVD cases were attributable to SSBs worldwide, representing 9.8% and 3.1%, respectively, of all incident cases. Globally, proportional SSB-attributable burdens were higher among men versus women, younger versus older adults, higher- versus lower-educated adults, and adults in urban versus rural areas. By world region, the highest SSB-attributable percentage burdens were in Latin America and the Caribbean (T2D: 24.4%; CVD: 11.3%) and sub-Saharan Africa (T2D: 21.5%; CVD: 10.5%). From 1990 to 2020, the largest proportional increases in SSB-attributable incident T2D and CVD cases were in sub-Saharan Africa (+8.8% and +4.4%, respectively). Our study highlights the countries and subpopulations most affected by cardiometabolic disease associated with SSB consumption, assisting in shaping effective policies and interventions to reduce these burdens globally.",

    "abstract": "Pongamia pinnata (L.) Pierre (Pongamia) is a tree native to Southeast Asia. Recently, interest in Pongamia focused on its potential as a biofuel source as its seeds contain around 40% oil. However, Pongamia has multiple applications beyond biofuel production. It is a legume, can form symbiotic associations with mycorrhizal fungi, has been shown to be tolerant to drought, salinity, and heavy metals in soil, and has potential to mitigate climate change. Additionally, Pongamia oil has medicinal properties, can be used as biopesticide, insect repellent, to produce soap, and as a source of edible grade vegetable oil. The seed cake can be used as a source of bioenergy, food and feed protein, and organic fertiliser, and the flowers are a good source of pollen and nectar. Pongamia can also bring socio-economic benefits as its ability to restore degraded and contaminated land provides opportunities for local communities through novel valorisation pathways. These multiple applications have potential to form part of a circular bioeconomy in line with sustainable development goals. Although research on the multiple applications of Pongamia has grown considerably, knowledge gaps remain and these need to be addressed so that the full potential of Pongamia can be achieved. Further understanding of the mechanisms underlying its resilience to abiotic stresses, phytoremediation potential and biotic interactions should be a priority, and co-ordinated breeding efforts will be key. Here, we critically review the available literature on Pongamia and highlight gaps in knowledge in which future research should focus on to ensure that the full potential of this versatile tree can be achieved. We conclude that Pongamia can potentially form part of a circular bioeconomy and that harnessing the multiple applications of Pongamia in a holistic manner, with collaboration among key stakeholders, is crucial for the successful application of its benefits far beyond biofuel production.",

Solar power generation is being identified as the most promising and abundant source for bulk power generation. However, solar photovoltaic panel is heavily dependent on meteorological data of the installation site and weather fluctuations. To overcome these issues, collecting performance data at the remotely installed photovoltaic panel and predicting future power generation is important. The key objective of this paper is to develop a scaled-down prototype of an IoT-enabled datalogger for photovoltaic system that is installed in a remote location where human intervention is not possible due to harsh weather conditions or other circumstances. An Internet of Things platform is used to store and visualize the captured data from a standalone photovoltaic system. The collected data from the datalogger is used as a training set for machine learning algorithms. The estimation of power generation is done by a linear regression algorithm. The results are been compared with results obtained by another machine learning algorithm such as polynomial regression and case-based reasoning. Further, a website is developed wherein the user can key in the date and time. The output of that transaction is predicted temperature, humidity, and forecasted power generation of the specific standalone photovoltaic system. The presented results and obtained characteristics confirm the superiority of the proposed techniques in predicting power generation.",

A part of this challenge is related to the type of natural environment such as floodable areas where flooding affects thousands of people every year and has a direct impact on their access to sanitation. Although there is a wide range of technological sanitation options for vulnerable communities, few publications explore their applicability to areas prone to constant natural floods, thereby hampering the possibilities for improving sanitation conditions in such areas. This review aims at compiling and consolidating current information on sanitation options for floodable areas with a focus on their technological, environmental, and managerial peculiarities. A systematic review identified 28 relevant publications presenting sanitation solutions for those environments. They were grouped into dry solutions and wet solutions. Our analysis showed that there is no single universal technology capable of solving the problem but instead, a set of different technological arrangements that could be implemented bearing in mind the environmental and social contexts in which they are inserted. This article has been made Open Access thanks to the generous support of a global network of libraries as part of the Knowledge Unlatched Select initiative.",

    "abstract": "Regional disparities between rural and urban areas in Indonesia are still being an important issue inthe economic development. The government has carried out an economic stimulus in the village,one of them is through the Village Fund program for village development. One of the potentialpositive effects of implementing the Village Fund in Indonesia is creating a local economicinstitution that is expected to be able to develop the competition between villages through Village-Owned Enterprises (BUMDes). This study aimed to find out the empirical evidence whetherBUMDes, as one of the programs driving the village economy affected the welfare of ruralcommunities by looking at the differences in the improvement of the village economy. This studyused BUMDes and Village Potential (Podes) data in 2014 and 2018, and Village Fund Allocationas a proxy for economic activity at the village level by using the econometric model approach ofPropensity Score Matching and Difference in Difference with a fixed effect model. The resultsshowed that villages that had BUMDes gave a greater effect than the ones which did not haveBUMDes in improving the economy of the village community.",

    "abstract": "An urgent demand for natural compound alternatives to conventional medications has arisen due to global health challenges, such as drug resistance and the adverse effects associated with synthetic drugs. Plant extracts are considered an alternative due to their favorable safety profiles and potential for reducing side effects. Sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) is a valuable plant resource and a potential candidate for the development of pharmaceutical medications. A single pure compound or a combination of compounds exhibits exceptional medicinal properties, including antiviral activity against both DNA and RNA viruses, antibacterial effects against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, antifungal properties, antioxidant activity, antidiabetic potential, neuroprotective qualities, and anticancer properties. The plant contains various phytochemical constituents, which mostly consist of linalool, eucalyptol, estragole, and eugenol. For centuries, community and traditional healers across the globe have employed O. basilicum L. to treat a wide range of ailments, including flu, fever, colds, as well as issues pertaining to digestion, reproduction, and respiration.

    "abstract": "AbstractSmart Agroforestry (SAF) is believed to be one of the alternative solutions in implementing sustainable forest management to achieve the community welfare. SAF provides agricultural and silvicultural knowledge and practices that aims not only for recovering the environmental attributes but also for increasing farmers resilience. However, the benefits of agroforestry related to soil fertility in optimizing the land productivity and governing the community livelihood are often overlooked and have not been well discussed. This review aims to describe how smart agroforestry practices in various regions in Indonesia and several other countries have significantly contributed to maintaining soil fertility and increasing crop production while assuring profitable benefits for the community. This review paper focuses on discussing the role of SAF in sustaining soil fertility and community livelihood in tropical and non-tropical regions. The review article was based on a synoptic review approach to SAF and Soil Fertility-related relevant publications and nationwide experiences. The review compiled and analyzed information from national and international research papers in various online scientific journals, conference proceedings and relevant books, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the topic being discussed. The study utilized a qualitative approach and drew upon primary and secondary sources based on a systematic review. Agroforestry has a significant role in recycling soil nutrients from the materials in the surrounding environment. SAF influences soil fertility physically, chemically and biologically. SAF practices in both wet and dry lands can contribute significantly to the community’s income. This review unveils the latent potential and the role of SAF in sustaining soil fertility that supports the community's livelihood and can serve as impetus for future research.",

    "abstract": "The recent analysis from IEA (International Energy Agency) on energy transition in India highlights that cooking continues to be the weakest link in the energy transition process for rural households and that rural energy transition of households to cleaner fuel is nonlinear in nature. Several programs have been designed to plague the voids and address this nonlinearity, but the transition to cleaner alternatives for cooking did not happen in the pace it should ideally have. Therefore, an empirical exercise was carried out at a national level to revisit the disconnect between the income growth and energy transition and identify the drivers of the energy transition process in cooking at the national as well as at the subnational state level for a developing country. The paper adds to the current scholarship on drivers of household energy transition by analyzing the relationship between household energy choices and non-income determinants and proves the nonlinearity in energy consumption of rural households of Bihar. Analyzing unit level record from National Sample Survey, an empirical exercise was carried out by using multinomial logit model to identify the potential determining factors at the individual household and group level. The group effect analysis through fixed and random effect has been conducted purposely to understand if social and cultural norms or community level factors within a village society have any effect on the cooking energy transition of rural households and if that offsets the effect of household income in energy transition for cooking. Furthermore, to statistically examine the perceived non-linearity in the consumption of cooking fuel such as firewood by rural households, Brock–Dechert–Scheinkman (BDS) test was conducted for rural households of 38 districts of Bihar. The analysis helps in inferring that subsidy on modern fuel and/or other cooking alternatives alone may not suffice to drive the transition process, but more targeted intervention rooted in the local cultural context in consonance with social and cultural norms or community level factors could be more effective for sustained rural energy transition.",

There is weaker evidence from a single study that dietary interventions may be beneficial.However, interventions that focus only on physical activity do not appear to be effective in children of this age. In contrast, interventions that only focus on physical activity can reduce the risk of obesity (BMI) in children aged 6 to 12 years, and adolescents aged 13 to 18 years. In these age groups, there is no evidence that interventions that only focus on diet are effective, and some evidence that diet combined with physical activity interventions may be effective. Importantly, this updated review also suggests that interventions to prevent childhood obesity do not appear to result in adverse effects or health inequalities.The review will not be updated in its current form. To manage the growth in RCTs of child obesity prevention interventions, in future, this review will be split into three separate reviews based on child age.",

We aim to estimate the burden of diabetes by type, year, regions, and socioeconomic status in 195 countries and territories over the past 28 years, which provide information to achieve the goal of World Health Organization Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases in 2025. Data were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017. Overall, the global burden of diabetes had increased significantly since 1990. Both the trend and magnitude of diabetes related diseases burden varied substantially across regions and countries. In 2017, global incidence, prevalence, death, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) associated with diabetes were 22.9 million, 476.0 million, 1.37 million, and 67.9 million, with a projection to 26.6 million, 570.9 million, 1.59 million, and 79.3 million in 2025, respectively. The trend of global type 2 diabetes burden was similar to that of total diabetes (including type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes), while global age-standardized rate of mortality and DALYs for type 1 diabetes declined. Globally, metabolic risks (high BMI) and behavioral factors (inappropriate diet, smoking, and low physical activity) contributed the most attributable death and DALYs of diabetes. These estimations could be useful in policy-making, priority setting, and resource allocation in diabetes prevention and treatment.",

    "abstract": "The importance of the gut-brain axis in maintaining homeostasis has long been appreciated. However, the past 15 yr have seen the emergence of the microbiota (the trillions of microorganisms within and on our bodies) as one of the key regulators of gut-brain function and has led to the appreciation of the importance of a distinct microbiota-gut-brain axis. This axis is gaining ever more traction in fields investigating the biological and physiological basis of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, age-related, and neurodegenerative disorders. The microbiota and the brain communicate with each other via various routes including the immune system, tryptophan metabolism, the vagus nerve and the enteric nervous system, involving microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, branched chain amino acids, and peptidoglycans. Many factors can influence microbiota composition in early life, including infection, mode of birth delivery, use of antibiotic medications, the nature of nutritional provision, environmental stressors, and host genetics. At the other extreme of life, microbial diversity diminishes with aging. Stress, in particular, can significantly impact the microbiota-gut-brain axis at all stages of life. Much recent work has implicated the gut microbiota in many conditions including autism, anxiety, obesity, schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease. Animal models have been paramount in linking the regulation of fundamental neural processes, such as neurogenesis and myelination, to microbiome activation of microglia. Moreover, translational human studies are ongoing and will greatly enhance the field. Future studies will focus on understanding the mechanisms underlying the microbiota-gut-brain axis and attempt to elucidate microbial-based intervention and therapeutic strategies for neuropsychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. Landslides are a ubiquitous hazard in terrestrial environments with slopes, incurring human fatalities in urban settlements, along transport corridors and at sites of rural industry. Assessment of landslide risk requires high-quality landslide databases. Recently, global landslide databases have shown the extent to which landslides impact on society and identified areas most at risk. Previous global analysis has focused on rainfall-triggered landslides over short ∼ 5-year observation periods. This paper presents spatiotemporal analysis of a global dataset of fatal non-seismic landslides, covering the period from January 2004 to December 2016. The data show that in total 55 997 people were killed in 4862 distinct landslide events. The spatial distribution of landslides is heterogeneous, with Asia representing the dominant geographical area. There are high levels of interannual variation in the occurrence of landslides. Although more active years coincide with recognised patterns of regional rainfall driven by climate anomalies, climate modes (such as El Niño–Southern Oscillation) cannot yet be related to landsliding, requiring a landslide dataset of 30+ years. Our analysis demonstrates that landslide occurrence triggered by human activity is increasing, in particular in relation to construction, illegal mining and hill cutting. This supports notions that human disturbance may be more detrimental to future landslide incidence than climate.",

    "abstract": "Executive Summary<br/>Eye health and vision have widespread and profound implications for many aspects of life, health, sustainable development, and the economy. Yet nowadays, many people, families, and populations continue to suffer the consequences of poor access to high-quality, affordable eye care, leading to vision impairment and blindness.<br/>In 2020, an estimated 596 million people had distance vision impairment worldwide, of whom 43 million were blind. Another 510 million people had uncorrected near vision impairment, simply because of not having reading spectacles. A large proportion of those affected (90%), live in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, encouragingly, more than 90% of people with vision impairment have a preventable or treatable cause with existing highly cost-effective interventions. Eye conditions affect all stages of life, with young children and older people being particularly affected. Crucially, women, rural populations, and ethnic minority groups are more likely to have vision impairment, and this pervasive inequality needs to be addressed. By 2050, population ageing, growth, and urbanisation might lead to an estimated 895 million people with distance vision impairment, of whom 61 million will be blind. Action to prioritise eye health is needed now.<br/>This Commission defines eye health as maximised vision, ocular health, and functional ability, thereby contributing to overall health and wellbeing, social inclusion, and quality of life. Eye health is essential to achieve many of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Poor eye health and impaired vision have a negative effect on quality of life and restrict equitable access to and achievement in education and the workplace. Vision loss has substantial financial implications for affected individuals, families, and communities. Although high-quality data for global economic estimates are scarce, particularly for LMICs, conservative assessments based on the latest prevalence figures for 2020 suggest that annual global productivity loss from vision impairment is approximately US$410·7 billion purchasing power parity. Vision impairment reduces mobility, affects mental wellbeing, exacerbates risk of dementia, increases likelihood of falls and road traffic crashes, increases the need for social care, and ultimately leads to higher mortality rates.<br/>By contrast, vision facilitates many daily life activities, enables better educational outcomes, and increases work productivity, reducing inequality. An increasing amount of evidence shows the potential for vision to advance the SDGs, by contributing towards poverty reduction, zero hunger, good health and wellbeing, quality education, gender equality, and decent work. Eye health is a global public priority, transforming lives in both poor and wealthy communities. Therefore, eye health needs to be reframed as a development as well as a health issue and given greater prominence within the global development and health agendas.<br/>Vision loss has many causes that require promotional, preventive, treatment, and rehabilitative interventions. Cataract, uncorrected refractive error, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy are responsible for most global vision impairment. Research has identified treatments to reduce or eliminate blindness from all these conditions; the priority is to deliver treatments where they are most needed. Proven eye care interventions, such as cataract surgery and spectacle provision, are among the most cost-effective in all of health care. Greater financial investment is needed so that millions of people living with unnecessary vision impairment and blindness can benefit from these interventions.<br/>Lessons from the past three decades give hope that this challenge can be met. Between 1990 and 2020, the age-standardised global prevalence of blindness fell by 28·5%. Since the 1990s, prevalence of major infectious causes of blindness—onchocerciasis and trachoma—have declined substantially. Hope remains that by 2030, the transmission of onchocerciasis will be interrupted, and trachoma will be eliminated as a public health problem in every country worldwide. However, the ageing population has led to a higher crude prevalence of age-related causes of blindness, and thus an increased total number of people with blindness in some regions.",

Integrated assessment model results for 14 different emissions species and 13 emissions sectors are provided for each scenario with consistent transitions from the historical data used in CMIP6 to future trajectories using automated harmonization before being downscaled to provide higher emissions source spatial detail. We find that the scenarios span a wide range of end-of-century radiative forcing values, thus making this set of scenarios ideal for exploring a variety of warming pathways. The set of scenarios is bounded on the low end by a 1.9 W m−2 scenario, ideal for analyzing a world with end-of-century temperatures well below 2 ∘C, and on the high end by a 8.5 W m−2 scenario, resulting in an increase in warming of nearly 5 ∘C over pre-industrial levels. Between these two extremes, scenarios are provided such that differences between forcing outcomes provide statistically significant regional temperature outcomes to maximize their usefulness for downstream experiments within CMIP6. A wide range of scenario data products are provided for the CMIP6 scientific community including global, regional, and gridded emissions datasets.",

    "abstract": "Despite dramatic improvements in survival, nutrition, and education over recent decades, today's children face an uncertain future. Climate change, ecological degradation, migrating populations, conflict, pervasive inequalities, and predatory commercial practices threaten the health and future of children in every country. In 2015, the world's countries agreed on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), yet nearly 5 years later, few countries have recorded much progress towards achieving them. This Commission presents the case for placing children, aged 0–18 years, at the centre of the SDGs: at the heart of the concept of sustainability and our shared human endeavour. Governments must harness coalitions across sectors to overcome ecological and commercial pressures to ensure children receive their rights and entitlements now and a liveable planet in the years to come. The evidence is clear: early investments in children's health, education, and development have benefits that compound throughout the child's lifetime, for their future children, and society as a whole. Successful societies invest in their children and protect their rights, as is evident from countries that have done well on health and economic measures over the past few decades. Yet many politicians still do not prioritise investing in children, nor see it as the foundation for broader societal improvements. Even in rich countries, many children go hungry or live in conditions of absolute poverty, especially those belonging to marginalised social groups—including indigenous populations and ethnic minorities. Too often, the potential of children with developmental disabilities is neglected, restricting their contributions to society. Additionally, many millions of children grow up scarred by war or insecurity, excluded from receiving the most basic health, educational, and developmental services. Decision makers need a long-term vision. Just as good health and nutrition in the prenatal period and early years lay the foundation for a healthy life course, the learning and social skills we acquire at a young age provide the basis for later development and support a strong national polity and economy. High-quality services with universal health-care coverage must be a top priority. The benefits of investing in children would be enormous, and the costs are not prohibitive: an analysis of the SDGs suggests a financing gap of US$195 per person. To ensure stronger economic and human development, each government must assess how to mobilise funding using instruments that help the poorest proportion of the population to meet this gap for children, and frame these as the most powerful investments a society can make. But investments are not just monetary: citizen participation and community action, including the voices of children themselves, are powerful forces for change that must be mobilised to reach the SDGs. Social movements must play a transformational role in demanding the rights that communities need to care for children and provide for families. Countries that support future generations put a high priority on ensuring all children's needs are met, by delivering entitlements, such as paid parental leave, free primary health care at the point of delivery, access to healthy—and sufficient amounts of—food, state-funded or subsidised education, and other social protection measures. These countries make sure children grow up in safe and healthy environments, with clean water and air and safe spaces to play. They respect the equal rights of girls, boys, and those with non-conforming gender identities. Policy makers in these countries are concerned with the effect of all policies on all children, but especially those in poorer families and marginalised populations, starting by ensuring birth registration so that the government can provide for children across the life course, and help them to become engaged and productive adult citizens. The rights and entitlements of children are enshrined within the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) ratified by all countries, except the USA. Countries might provide these entitlements in different ways, but their realisation is the only pathway for countries to achieve the SDGs for children's health and wellbeing, and requires decisive and strong public action. Since threats to child health and wellbeing originate in all sectors, a deliberately multisectoral approach is needed to ensure children and adolescents survive and thrive from the ages of 0–18 years, today and in the future. Investment in sectors beyond health and education—such as housing, agriculture, energy, and transport—are needed to address the greatest threats to child health and wellbeing. Political commitment at executive level is needed to coordinate across sectors and leverage synergies across the life course, ensuring universal health coverage; good nutrition and food security for all; thoughtful urban planning; safe and affordable housing and transport; clean energy for all; and equitable social welfare policies. Multisectoral governance might take different forms in each country, but it will require strategic partnerships, cabinet-level coordination across ministries, and management of diverse partners, with clear roles for each, including for non-state actors and the private sector. Heads of state or prime ministers must designate a cross-cutting government ministry or equivalent to ensure joined-up action and budgeting for pro-child policies and to demand harmonised assistance from global stakeholders, whose support is currently fragmented and inefficient. Wealthy countries generally have better child health and development outcomes, but their historic and current greenhouse gas emissions threaten the lives of all children. The ecological damage unleashed today endangers the future of children's lives on our planet, their only home. As a result, our understanding of progress on child health and wellbeing must give priority to measures of ecological sustainability and equity to ensure we protect all children, including the most vulnerable. We assessed the feasibility of monitoring countries' progress through a new child flourishing and futures profile, developed on the basis of survive and thrive SDG indicators reported by 180 countries, territories, and areas (hereafter referred to as countries), and future threats to children's wellbeing using the proxy of greenhouse gas emissions by country. We also complemented the profile with existing measures of economic equity. The poorest countries have a long way to go towards supporting their children's ability to live healthy lives, but wealthier countries threaten the future of all children through carbon pollution, on course to cause runaway climate change and environmental disaster. Not a single country performed well on all three measures of child flourishing, sustainability, and equity. The SDG indicators already provide a strong foundation for monitoring progress. However, we only found a very small amount of country data for the indicators used to track child health and wellbeing, which all countries agreed to collect. SDG monitoring needs a strong boost in investment to bridge the large data gaps in key indicators (with <50% of countries reporting data for many indicators), to allow for subnational disaggregation if governments are to monitor, review, and act. To ensure our children grow and flourish, we require timely and accurate population data on health, nutrition, educational access and performance, housing, and environmental security, among other entitlements. Harnessing the power of citizen accountability mechanisms will be essential to fill the data gaps. We also propose the development of user-friendly country dashboards to assess the effects on children's wellbeing and sustainable development. Given the urgency for action, regular reports on the SDGs to the UN General Assembly must be the anchor of strong advocacy on action for children everywhere. Although we recognise the role business plays in wealth and job creation, the commercial sector's profit motive poses many threats to child health and wellbeing, not least the environmental damage unleashed by unregulated industry. More immediately, children around the world are enormously exposed to advertising from business, whose marketing techniques exploit their developmental vulnerability and whose products can harm their health and wellbeing. Companies make huge profits from marketing products directly to children and promoting addictive or unhealthy commodities, including fast foods, sugar-sweetened beverages, alcohol, and tobacco, all of which are major causes of non-communicable diseases. Children's large and growing online exposure, while bringing benefits in terms of information access and social support, also exposes them to exploitation, as well as to bullying, gambling, and grooming by criminals and sexual abusers. Industry self-regulation does not work, and the existing global frameworks are not sufficient. A far stronger and more comprehensive approach to regulation is required. We call for the development of an Optional Protocol to the CRC (ie, an additional component to the treaty that must be independently ratified), to protect children from the marketing of tobacco, alcohol, formula milk, sugar-sweetened beverages, gambling, and potentially damaging social media, and the inappropriate use of their personal data. Countries who have led the way in protecting children from the harms of commercial marketing, supported by civil society, can support a protocol for adoption by the UN General Assembly, providing impetus for further legal and constitutional protections for children at national level. Children and young people are full of energy, ideas, and hope for the future. They are also angry at the state of the world. Worldwide, school-children and young people are protesting about environmental threats from fossil fuel economies. We must find better ways to amplify their voices and skills for the planet's sustainable and healthy future. The SDGs require governments to place children at the very centre of their plans to address this crisis. This Commission makes positive and optimistic recommendations–but we have no time to lose, and no excuses if we fail. A new global movement for child and adolescent health is today an urgent necessity.",

Imminent fiscal recovery packages could entrench or partly displace the current fossil-fuel-intensive economic system. Here, we survey 231 central bank officials, finance ministry officials, and other economic experts from G20 countries on the relative performance of 25 major fiscal recovery archetypes across four dimensions: speed of implementation, economic multiplier, climate impact potential, and overall desirability. We identify five policies with high potential on both economic multiplier and climate impact metrics: clean physical infrastructure, building efficiency retrofits, investment in education and training, natural capital investment, and clean R&amp;D. In lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs) rural support spending is of particular value while clean R&amp;D is less important. These recommendations are contextualized through analysis of the short-run impacts of COVID-19 on greenhouse gas curtailment and plausible medium-run shifts in the habits and behaviours of humans and institutions.",

Detailed CO 2 emission inventories by energy and sector have great significance to China’s carbon policies as well as to achieving global climate change mitigation targets. This study constructs the most up-to-date CO 2 emission inventories for China and its 30 provinces, as well as their energy inventories for the years 2016 and 2017. The newly compiled inventories provide key updates and supplements to our previous emission dataset for 1997–2015. Emissions are calculated based on IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) administrative territorial scope that covers all anthropogenic emissions generated within an administrative boundary due to energy consumption (i.e. energy-related emissions from 17 fossil fuel types) and industrial production (i.e. process-related emissions from cement production). The inventories are constructed for 47 economic sectors consistent with the national economic accounting system. The data can be used as inputs to climate and integrated assessment models and for analysis of emission patterns of China and its regions.",

This scoping review aims to assess the available literature related to climate change and mental health across the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) five global research priorities for protecting human health from climate change. We conducted a scoping review to identify original research studies related to mental health and climate change using online academic databases. We assessed the quality of studies where appropriate assessment tools were available. We identified 120 original studies published between 2001 and 2020. Most studies were quantitative (n = 67), cross-sectional (n = 42), conducted in high-income countries (n = 87), and concerned with the first of the WHO global research priorities—assessing the mental health risks associated with climate change (n = 101). Several climate-related exposures, including heat, humidity, rainfall, drought, wildfires, and floods were associated with psychological distress, worsened mental health, and higher mortality among people with pre-existing mental health conditions, increased psychiatric hospitalisations, and heightened suicide rates. Few studies (n = 19) addressed the other four global research priorities of protecting health from climate change (effective interventions (n = 8); mitigation and adaptation (n = 7); improving decision-support (n = 3); and cost estimations (n = 1)). While climate change and mental health represents a rapidly growing area of research, it needs to accelerate and broaden in scope to respond with evidence-based mitigation and adaptation strategies.",

    "abstract": "Low carbon transitions are often assumed as normative goods, because they supposedly reduce carbon emissions, yet without vigilance there is evidence that they can in fact create new injustices and vulnerabilities, while also failing to address pre-existing structural drivers of injustice in energy markets and the wider socio-economy. With this in mind, we examine four European low-carbon transitions from an unusual normative perspective: that of energy justice. Because a multitude of studies looks at the co-benefits renewable energy, low-carbon mobility, or climate change mitigation, we instead ask in this paper: what are the types of injustices associated with low-carbon transitions? Relatedly, in what ways do low-carbon transitions worsen social risks or vulnerabilities? Lastly, what policies might be deployed to make these transitions more just? We answer these questions by first elaborating an “energy justice” framework consisting of four distinct dimensions—distributive justice (costs and benefits), procedural justice (due process), cosmopolitan justice (global externalities), and recognition justice (vulnerable groups). We then examine four European low-carbon transitions—nuclear power in France, smart meters in Great Britain, electric vehicles in Norway, and solar energy in Germany—through this critical justice lens. In doing so, we draw from original data collected from 64 semi-structured interviews with expert partisans as well as five public focus groups and the monitoring of twelve internet forums. We document 120 distinct energy injustices across these four transitions, including 19 commonly recurring injustices. We aim to show how when low-carbon transitions unfold, deeper injustices related to equity, distribution, and fairness invariably arise.",

In addition to the value of each case by country, the synthesis of this research suggests that the current practices can be defined as emergency remote education and this practice is different from planned practices such as distance education, online learning or other derivations. Above all, this study points out how social injustice, inequity and the digital divide have been exacerbated during the pandemic and need unique and targeted measures if they are to be addressed. While there are support communities and mechanisms, parents are overburdened between regular daily/professional duties and emerging educational roles, and all parties are experiencing trauma, psychological pressure and anxiety to various degrees, which necessitates a pedagogy of care, affection and empathy. In terms of educational processes, the interruption of education signifies the importance of openness in education and highlights issues that should be taken into consideration such as using alternative assessment and evaluation methods as well as concerns about surveillance, ethics, and data privacy resulting from nearly exclusive dependency on online solutions.",

    "abstract": "Solid Waste Management (SWM) is a multifaceted problem comprising political, socioeconomic, institutional, and environmental aspects. Due to exponential urban growth, it has become one of the most significant issues faced by urban spaces in developing countries. The gap in environmental knowledge among the youth and the old within developing countries contribute to ecological issues or waste management problems, resulting in unsustainable development, with important consequences in low-income countries. For that matter, a systematic review was conducted aiming to identify and analyse environmental knowledge, awareness, attitudes, and practice studies on SWM from 2010 to 2019 in developing countries. The evidence suggests that students at both secondary and tertiary levels have positive environmental attitudes, and high awareness of environmental issues, but there is a lack of practical education of teachers to guide students to put SWM into practice. Student’s low environmental knowledge is related to a deficiency in teachers’ practical experience in SWM for environmental sustainability. A relationship between teachers’ and students’ knowledge and attitudes towards SWM, as well as differences in awareness, attitude, and practices of SWM linked with education and age, were also found. This review also revealed that the lack of environmental education in most developing countries is caused by fragilities in practical environmental curricula of teachers to respond to modern-day environmental issues for sustainable development and cleaner production (CP). To bridge the knowledge gap between the youth and older people in SWM, environmental sustainability education should be integrated into schools at all levels within developing countries.",

Surface coal mining and processing impose public health risks on residential communities through air and water pollution. Burning coal in power plants emits more nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, and heavy metals per unit of energy than any other fuel source and impairs global public health. Coal ash disposal exposes communities to heavy metals and particulate matter waste. Use of coal in domestic households causes public health harm concentrated in developing nations. Across the coal continuum, adverse impacts are disproportionately felt by persons of poor socioeconomic status, contributing to health inequities. Despite efforts to develop renewable energy sources, coal use has not declined on a global scale. Concentrated efforts to eliminate coal as an energy source are imperative to improve public health and avert serious climate change consequences.",

    "abstract": "Over recent decades, people’s (rural and urban) communities are facing numerous social and economic changes and challenges. Some of those challenges have been increasingly addressed through the lenses of technological developments and digitalization. In this paper, we have made a review of already existing practices while focusing on the existing implementations of the Smart Village concept and the importance of digital transformation for rural areas. We give special attention to EU policies that we are using as an already existing framework for understanding our own forthcoming examples. We have shown the parallels between the findings and insights from different regions and made an evaluation of presented practices. Our main argument stems from our own previous experiences and experiences of other research approaches, and is grounded on the argument that rural areas are not uniform, and that smart rural development has to be applied in combination with place-based approach. We present the cases of Slovenian pilot practices and support our argument by proposing the FabVillage concept.",

    "abstract": "Like previous educational technologies, artificial intelligence in education (AIEd) threatens to disrupt the status quo, with proponents highlighting the potential for efficiency and democratization, and skeptics warning of industrialization and alienation. However, unlike frequently discussed applications of AI in autonomous vehicles, military and cybersecurity concerns, and healthcare, AI's impacts on education policy and practice have not yet captured the public's attention. This paper, therefore, evaluates the status of AIEd, with special attention to intelligent tutoring systems and anthropomorphized artificial educational agents. I discuss AIEd's purported capacities, including the abilities to simulate teachers, provide robust student differentiation, and even foster socio-emotional engagement. Next, to situate developmental pathways for AIEd going forward, I contrast sociotechnical possibilities and risks through two idealized futures. Finally, I consider a recent proposal to use peer review as a gatekeeping strategy to prevent harmful research. This proposal serves as a jumping off point for recommendations to AIEd stakeholders towards improving their engagement with socially responsible research and implementation of AI in educational systems.",

    "abstract": "Given its associated burden of disease, climate change in South Africa could be reframed as predominately a health issue, one necessitating an urgent health-sector response. The growing impact of climate change has major implications for South Africa, especially for the numerous vulnerable groups in the country. We systematically reviewed the literature by searching PubMed and Web of Science. Of the 820 papers screened, 34 were identified that assessed the impacts of climate change on health in the country. Most papers covered effects of heat on health or on infectious diseases (20/34; 59%). We found that extreme weather events are the most noticeable effects to date, especially droughts in the Western Cape, but rises in vector-borne diseases are gaining prominence. Climate aberration is also linked in myriad ways with outbreaks of food and waterborne diseases, and possibly with the recent Listeria epidemic. The potential impacts of climate change on mental health may compound the multiple social stressors that already beset the populace. Climate change heightens the pre-existing vulnerabilities of women, fishing communities, rural subsistence farmers and those living in informal settlements. Further gender disparities, eco-migration and social disruptions may undermine the prevention—but also treatment—of HIV. Our findings suggest that focused research and effective use of surveillance data are required to monitor climate change’s impacts; traditional strengths of the country’s health sector. The health sector, hitherto a fringe player, should assume a greater leadership role in promoting policies that protect the public’s health, address inequities and advance the country’s commitments to climate change accords.",

    "abstract": "Water quality depends on its physicochemical and biological parameters. Changes in parameters such as pH, temperature, and essential and non-essential trace metals in water can render it unfit for human use. Moreover, the characteristics of the local environment, geological processes, geochemistry, and hydrological properties of water sources also affect water quality. Generally, groundwater is utilized for drinking purposes all over the globe. The surface is also utilized for human use and industrial purposes. There are several natural and anthropogenic activities responsible for the heavy metal contamination of water. Industrial sources, including coal washery, steel industry, food processing industry, plastic processing, metallic work, leather tanning, etc., are responsible for heavy metal contamination in water. Domestic and agricultural waste is also responsible for hazardous metallic contamination in water. Contaminated water with heavy metal ions like Cr (VI), Cd (II), Pb (II), As (V and III), Hg (II), Ni (II), and Cu (II) is responsible for several health issues in humans, like liver failure, kidney damage, gastric and skin cancer, mental disorders and harmful effects on the reproductive system. Hence, the evaluation of heavy metal contamination in water and its removal is needed. There are several physicochemical methods that are available for the removal of heavy metals from water, but these methods are expensive and generate large amounts of secondary pollutants. Biological methods are considered cost-effective and eco-friendly methods for the remediation of metallic contaminants from water. In this review, we focused on water contamination with toxic heavy metals and their toxicity and eco-friendly bioremediation approaches.",

    "abstract": "Abstract An increased nitrate (NO 3 − ) concentration in groundwater has been a rising issue on a global scale in recent years. Different consumption mechanisms clearly illustrate the adverse effects on human health. The goal of this present study is to assess the natural and anthropogenic NO 3 − concentrations in groundwater in a semi arid area of Rajasthan and its related risks to human health in the different groups of ages such as children, males, and females. We have found that most of the samples (n = 90) were influenced by anthropogenic activities. The background level of NO 3 − had been estimated as 7.2 mg/L using a probabilistic approach. About 93% of nitrate samples exceeded the background limit, while 28% of the samples were beyond the permissible limit of 45 mg/L as per the BIS limits. The results show that the oral exposure of nitrate was very high as compare to dermal contact. With regard to the non-carcinogenic health risk, the total Hazard Index (HI Total ) values of groundwater nitrate were an average of 0.895 for males, 1.058 for females, and 1.214 for children. The nitrate health risk assessment shows that about 38%, 46%, and 49% of the samples constitute the non-carcinogenic health risk to males, females, and children, respectively. Children were found to be more prone to health risks due to the potential exposure to groundwater nitrate.",

Nigeria’s gross domestic product is the largest in Africa, but its per capita income of about ₦770 000 (US$2000) is low with a highly inequitable distribution of income, wealth, and therefore, health. It is a picture of poverty amidst plenty. Nigeria is both a wealthy country and a very poor one. About 40% of Nigerians live in poverty, in social conditions that create ill health, and with the ever-present risk of catastrophic expenditures from high out-of-pocket spending for health. Even compared with countries of similar income levels in Africa, Nigeria’s population health outcomes are poor, with national statistics masking drastic differences between rich and poor, urban and rural populations, and different regions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Voters are understandably concerned about election security. News reports of possible election interference by foreign powers, of unauthorized voting, of voter disenfranchisement, and of technological failures call into question the integrity of elections worldwide. This article examines the suggestions that “voting over the Internet” or “voting on the blockchain” would increase election security, and finds such claims to be wanting and misleading. While current election systems are far from perfect, Internet- and blockchain-based voting would greatly increase the risk of undetectable, nation-scale election failures. Online voting may seem appealing: voting from a computer or smartphone may seem convenient and accessible. However, studies have been inconclusive, showing that online voting may have little to no effect on turnout in practice, and it may even increase disenfranchisement. More importantly, given the current state of computer security, any turnout increase derived from Internet- or blockchain-based voting would come at the cost of losing meaningful assurance that votes have been counted as they were cast, and not undetectably altered or discarded. This state of affairs will continue as long as standard tactics such as malware, zero day, and denial-of-service attacks continue to be effective. This article analyzes and systematizes prior research on the security risks of online and electronic voting, and shows that not only do these risks persist in blockchain-based voting systems, but blockchains may introduce ‘additional’ problems for voting systems. Finally, we suggest questions for critically assessing security risks of new voting system proposals.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the processes of migrant labour exploitation which are crucial for capitalist growth and the inequalities they generate. Ethnographic research conducted in different sites across India shows how patterns of seasonal labour migration are driven by class relations marked by hierarchies of identity (caste and tribe) and the spatial geopolitics of internal colonialism (region) – differences that are mobilised for accumulation. Labour migration scholarship has mainly explored sites of production. We extend recent social reproduction theory (SRT) and an older literature on labour migration and reproduction to argue that the intimate relationship between production and social reproduction is crucial to the exploitation of migrant labour and that this means we have to place centre‐stage the analysis of invisible economies of care which take place across spatiotemporally divided households, both in the place of migration and in the home regions of migrants. Furthermore, we develop recent work on SRT and migration to argue that an analysis of kinship (gender over generations, not just gender) is crucial to these invisible economies of care. This analysis is important in showing the machinations of capitalist growth and for political alternatives.",

In contrast, Australia and the United States of America (USA) have greatly lowered their annual rates of lung diseases since the 1970s. This paper systematically compared and analysed the multi-elements of coal dust management and health management in these three countries to provide a reference for China. Regarding coal dust management, this paper found that coal workers in China are more susceptible to lung diseases compared to workers in the USA and Australia, considering fundamental aspects such as mine type, coal rank, and geological conditions. In addition, the controllable aspects such as advanced mitigation, monitoring methods, and the personal protective equipment of coal dust were relatively inadequate in China compared to the USA and Australia. Health management in China was found to have multiple deficiencies in health examination, co-governance, and compensations for coal workers suffering from lung diseases and healthcare for retired coal workers. These deficiencies may be attributed to insufficient medical resources, the Chinese government-dominated governance, ineffective procedures for obtaining compensation, and the lack of effective and preventive healthcare programs for the retired coal workers. Based on the USA and Australia experience, some suggestions for improvement were proposed.",

    "abstract": "Energy poverty is a significant development issue that is not univocally interpreted. In many parts of the world, people do not have access to modern and reliable energy, which can be a big problem, particularly for vulnerable and developing countries. When vulnerable people do not have access to energy, they will often not be able to get the power they need to improve their lives. In addition, they may not be able to get proper food, education, health, sanitation, or basic needs for daily living. We use interval-based composite indicators and triplex representations of intervals to measure and assess access to electricity in 54 developing countries as a concept approximating relevant aspects of energy poverty. The proposed composite metric is innovative because it accurately quantifies how much electricity is available to people and how resilient and vulnerable people in developing countries are when they lose access to energy. After comparing the different representations, we found that one group of developing countries is more vulnerable to national and international events than the other. However, other countries are more resilient to electricity access problems. Conflicts and wars can impact the index used to measure energy poverty. However, as measured by the index, these factors contribute to poor performance.",

    "abstract": "Research background: The increasing demand for energy, driven by economic growth and population expansion, is a critical driver of societal progress. However, the predominant reliance on fossil fuels to meet this demand presents significant challenges, particularly in the rapidly developing BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). These countries are faced with a complex interplay of energy security and environmental sustainability issues, stemming from their substantial fossil fuel reserves and the associated environmental consequences. The challenges manifest as inequalities in access to clean energy, environmental degradation, and heightened vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. Addressing these multifaceted issues requires a comprehensive approach. Metrics-based strategies, which employ aggregated indices derived from a diverse set of energy and environmental indicators, have the potential to provide valuable insights into these complexities. However, the development of a universally applicable energy sustainability index is complicated by the heterogeneity of metrics, disparities between countries, and methodological challenges, emphasizing the need for an innovative and holistic analytical framework. Purpose of the article: This study aims to develop a tailored Energy Security and Environmental Sustainability Index for BRICS economies to evaluate the robustness of their energy systems and the viability of their ecological practices. The index serves as an instrument to assess the progress of these nations in the Energy and Environment domain and identify areas that require targeted interventions and improvements. Methods: The construction of the composite ESESI involves the selection of relevant parameters and the application of a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) framework in conjunction with the Weighted Product Method (WPM). To ensure objectivity in the determination of optimal and least favorable weights for each indicator, the study employs the Multiplicative Data Envelopment Analysis (MDEA) model. Findings &amp; value added: The ESESI analysis reveals disparities in the progress made by BRICS nations in enhancing energy security, promoting renewable energy deployment, and mitigating environmental impacts. While some countries demonstrate substantial advancements, others face challenges in improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions. The study underscores the necessity for tailored policies and targeted infrastructural enhancements that align with the unique challenges and strengths of each nation. Harnessing the abundant renewable energy potential through advanced energy trade mechanisms and fostering cross-border investments are identified as crucial strategies for ensuring environmental sustainability and long-term energy in the BRICS region. The ESESI provides a valuable tool for policymakers and researchers to evaluate the progress of BRICS nations in achieving sustainable energy goals and to inform evidence-based decision-making processes. By offering a comprehensive and scientifically rigorous assessment framework, this study contributes to the ongoing discourse on sustainable energy transitions and environmental stewardship in the context of rapidly developing economies.",

    "abstract": "Our study evaluated the effectiveness of using eight pathways in combination for a complete to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy by 2050. These pathways included renewable energy development; improving energy efficiency; increasing energy conservation; carbon taxes; more equitable balancing of human wellbeing and per capita energy use; cap and trade systems; carbon capture, utilization, and storage; and nuclear power development. We used the annual ‘British Petroleum statistical review of world energy 2021’ report as our primary database. Globally, fossil fuels, renewable (primarily hydro, wind and solar), nuclear energy accounted for 83%, 12.6%, and 6.3% of the total energy consumption in 2020. To achieve zero fossil fuel use by 2050, we found that renewable energy production will need to be increased by up to 6-fold or 8-fold if energy demand is held constant at, or increased 50% from, the 2020 energy demand level. Constraining 2050 world energy demand to a 25% increase over the 2020 level, improves the probability of achieving independence from fossil fuels. Improvements in energy efficiency need to accelerate beyond the current rate of ~1.5% per year. Aggressive application of energy conservation policies involving land use and taxation could potentially reduce world energy use by 10% or more by 2050. Our meta-analysis shows that the minimum level of per capita energy consumption that would allow 8 billion people to have a ‘Decent Living Standard’ is on average ~70 GJ per capita per year, which is 93% of the 2020 global average. Developed countries in temperate climates with high vehicle-dependency needed ~120 GJ per capita year−1, whereas equatorial countries with low vehicle-dependency needed 30 GJ per capita year−1. Our meta-analyses indicated replacement of fossil fuels with renewable energy by 2050 may be possible but will require aggressive application of all eight pathways, major lifestyle changes in developed countries, and close cooperation among all countries.",

    "abstract": "We present a framework for understanding the effects of automation and other types of technological changes on labor demand, and use it to interpret changes in US employment over the recent past. At the center of our framework is the allocation of tasks to capital and labor—the task content of production. Automation, which enables capital to replace labor in tasks it was previously engaged in, shifts the task content of production against labor because of a displacement effect. As a result, automation always reduces the labor share in value added and may reduce labor demand even as it raises productivity. The effects of automation are counterbalanced by the creation of new tasks in which labor has a comparative advantage. The introduction of new tasks changes the task content of production in favor of labor because of a reinstatement effect, and always raises the labor share and labor demand. We show how the role of changes in the task content of production—due to automation and new tasks—can be inferred from industry-level data. Our empirical decomposition suggests that the slower growth of employment over the last three decades is accounted for by an acceleration in the displacement effect, especially in manufacturing, a weaker reinstatement effect, and slower growth of productivity than in previous decades.",

    "abstract": "Significance North American and European countries built many large dams until 1975, after which both started to abandon a significant part of their installed hydropower because of the negative social and environmental impacts. However, there has been a recent trend of new large hydropower dams being built in developing countries, particularly in megabiodiversity river basins, such as the Amazon, the Congo, and the Mekong. The socioeconomic and environmental damages in these river systems are even greater than the early costs in North America and Europe. This paper discusses how the hydropower sector needs to not only focus on energy production but also, include the negative social and environmental externalities caused by dams and recognize the unsustainability of current common practices.",

As low-carbon energy technologies advance, markets are driving demand for energy transition metals. Increased extraction rates will augment the stress placed on people and the environment in extractive locations. To quantify this stress, we develop a set of global composite environmental, social and governance indicators, and examine mining projects across 20 metal commodities to identify the co-occurrence of environmental, social and governance risk factors. Our findings show that 84% of platinum resources and 70% of cobalt resources are located in high-risk contexts. Reflecting heightened demand, major metals like iron and copper are set to disturb more land. Jurisdictions extracting energy transition metals in low-risk contexts are positioned to develop and maintain safeguards against mining-related social and environmental risk factors.",

    "abstract": "Sustainable development addresses humanity’s aspiration for a better life while observing the limitations imposed by nature. In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly approved the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with the aim to foster the organizational operationalization and integration of sustainability and, therefore, to address the current and forthcoming stakeholder needs and ensure a better and sustainable future for all, balancing the economic, social, and environmental development. However, it is not entirely clear which are the mutual relationships among the 17 SDGs and this study aims to tackle this research gap. The results of the correlation confirm that Poverty elimination (SDG1) and Good health and well-being (SDG3) have synergetic relationships with most of the other goals. SDG7 (Affordable and clean energy) has significant relationships with other SDGs (e.g., SDG1 (No poverty), SDG2 (Zero hunger), SDG3 (Good health and well-being), SDG8 (Decent work and economic growth), SDG13 (Climate action)). However, there is a moderate negative correlation with SDG12 (Responsible consumption and production), which emphasizes the need to improve energy efficiency, increase the share of clean and renewable energies and improve sustainable consumption patterns worldwide. There is also confirmation that SDG12 (Responsible consumption and production) is the goal strongly associated with trade-offs. To sum up, this research suggests that change towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals offers many opportunities for reinforcing rather than inhibiting itself. However, some SDGs show no significant correlation with other SDGs (e.g., SDG13 (Climate action) and SDG17 (Partnerships for the goals), which highlights the need for future research.",

While there have been numerous reviews of empirical studies on the link between nature and human health, very few have focused on the urban context, and most have examined almost exclusively cross-sectional research. This review is a first step toward assessing the possibility of causal relationships between nature and health in urban settings. Methods: Through systematic review of published literature, we explored the association between urban green space and human health. Results: We found consistent negative association between urban green space exposure and mortality, heart rate, and violence, and positive association with attention, mood, and physical activity. Results were mixed, or no association was found, in studies of urban green space exposure and general health, weight status, depression, and stress (via cortisol concentration). The number of studies was too low to generalize about birth outcomes, blood pressure, heart rate variability, cancer, diabetes, or respiratory symptoms. Conclusions: More studies using rigorous study design are needed to make generalizations, and meta-analyses, of these and other health outcomes possible. These findings may assist urban managers, organizations, and communities in their efforts to increase new or preserve existing green space.",

    "abstract": "The surface urban heat island (SUHI), which represents the difference of land surface temperature (LST) in urban relativity to neighboring non-urban surfaces, is usually measured using satellite LST data. Over the last few decades, advancements of remote sensing along with spatial science have considerably increased the number and quality of SUHI studies that form the major body of the urban heat island (UHI) literature. This paper provides a systematic review of satellite-based SUHI studies, from their origin in 1972 to the present. We find an exponentially increasing trend of SUHI research since 2005, with clear preferences for geographic areas, time of day, seasons, research foci, and platforms/sensors. The most frequently studied region and time period of research are China and summer daytime, respectively. Nearly two-thirds of the studies focus on the SUHI/LST variability at a local scale. The Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+)/Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and Terra/Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are the two most commonly-used satellite sensors and account for about 78% of the total publications. We systematically reviewed the main satellite/sensors, methods, key findings, and challenges of the SUHI research. Previous studies confirm that the large spatial (local to global scales) and temporal (diurnal, seasonal, and inter-annual) variations of SUHI are contributed by a variety of factors such as impervious surface area, vegetation cover, landscape structure, albedo, and climate. However, applications of SUHI research are largely impeded by a series of data and methodological limitations. Lastly, we propose key potential directions and opportunities for future efforts. Besides improving the quality and quantity of LST data, more attention should be focused on understudied regions/cities, methods to examine SUHI intensity, inter-annual variability and long-term trends of SUHI, scaling issues of SUHI, the relationship between surface and subsurface UHIs, and the integration of remote sensing with field observations and numeric modeling.",

This paper, assesses the clean fuel gap across social groups in India using three rounds of representative data (2004, 2014, and 2018) by applying the logit model, exogenous switching treatment effect regression (ESTER), and the Blinder–Oaxaca Decomposition Model. Such an analysis is instrumental in identifying the clean energy usage gap and its causes, thereby providing insight to policymakers to design policies to achieve just energy transition and carbon neutrality by 2060. The results show a substantive clean fuel gap between social groups in India, which is a cause of concern for just energy transition. Clean energy utilization gaps among social groups are alarming across geographical locations and consumption quartiles, highlighting the importance of recognition justice for just energy transition. The results show that in rural areas, only 19.6 % of the General Caste households and 14.5 % of the disadvantaged social groups (Scheduled Tribes, Scheduled Castes, and Other Backward Class) in quartile one use clean energy, while in urban areas, the shares are 60.4 % and 46.3 %, respectively. To achieve a just distribution of the benefits of energy transition, energy policies should focus on disadvantaged social groups and simultaneously target General Caste households from a lower economic status and those residing in rural areas, indicating the need for targeting the neglected regions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Water availability is a major factor constraining humanity's ability to meet the future food and energy needs of a growing and increasingly affluent human population. Water plays an important role in the production of energy, including renewable energy sources and the extraction of unconventional fossil fuels that are expected to become important players in future energy security. The emergent competition for water between the food and energy systems is increasingly recognized in the concept of the “food‐energy‐water nexus.” The nexus between food and water is made even more complex by the globalization of agriculture and rapid growth in food trade, which results in a massive virtual transfer of water among regions and plays an important role in the food and water security of some regions. This review explores multiple components of the food‐energy‐water nexus and highlights possible approaches that could be used to meet food and energy security with the limited renewable water resources of the planet. Despite clear tensions inherent in meeting the growing and changing demand for food and energy in the 21st century, the inherent linkages among food, water, and energy systems can offer an opportunity for synergistic strategies aimed at resilient food, water, and energy security, such as the circular economy.",

The report builds on the WGII contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the IPCC, three Special Reports, and the Working Group I (WGI) contribution to the AR6 cycle. This report recognizes the interdependence of climate, ecosystems and biodiversity3, and human societies (Figure SPM.1) and integrates knowledge more strongly across the natural, ecological, social and economic sciences than earlier IPCC assessments. The assessment of climate change impacts and risks as well as adaptation is set against concurrently unfolding non-climatic global trends e.g., biodiversity loss, overall unsustainable consumption of natural resources, land and ecosystem degradation, rapid urbanisation, human demographic shifts, social and economic inequalities and a pandemic.",

Case studies of individual cities suggest that heat exposure, like other environmental stressors, may be unequally distributed across income groups. There is little evidence, however, as to whether such disparities are pervasive. We combine surface urban heat island (SUHI) data, a proxy for isolating the urban contribution to additional heat exposure in built environments, with census tract-level demographic data to answer these questions for summer days, when heat exposure is likely to be at a maximum. We find that the average person of color lives in a census tract with higher SUHI intensity than non-Hispanic whites in all but 6 of the 175 largest urbanized areas in the continental United States. A similar pattern emerges for people living in households below the poverty line relative to those at more than two times the poverty line.",

Yet spatial projections of how much and where it may occur are often limited to short-term futures and small geographic areas. Here we produce a first empirically-grounded set of global, spatial urban land projections over the 21st century. We use a data-science approach exploiting 15 diverse datasets, including a newly available 40-year global time series of fine-spatial-resolution remote sensing observations. We find the global total amount of urban land could increase by a factor of 1.8–5.9, and the per capita amount by a factor of 1.1–4.9, across different socioeconomic scenarios over the century. Though the fastest urban land expansion occurs in Africa and Asia, the developed world experiences a similarly large amount of new development.",

In this topical review, we synthesise the literature to explain recent trends in global and regional emissions in each of these sectors. To contextualise our review, we present estimates of GHG emissions trends by sector from 1990 to 2018, describing the major sources of emissions growth, stability and decline across ten global regions. Overall, the literature and data emphasise that progress towards reducing GHG emissions has been limited. The prominent global pattern is a continuation of underlying drivers with few signs of emerging limits to demand, nor of a deep shift towards the delivery of low and zero carbon services across sectors. We observe a moderate decarbonisation of energy systems in Europe and North America, driven by fuel switching and the increasing penetration of renewables. By contrast, in rapidly industrialising regions, fossil-based energy systems have continuously expanded, only very recently slowing down in their growth. Strong demand for materials, floor area, energy services and travel have driven emissions growth in the industry, buildings and transport sectors, particularly in Eastern Asia, Southern Asia and South-East Asia. An expansion of agriculture into carbon-dense tropical forest areas has driven recent increases in AFOLU emissions in Latin America, South-East Asia and Africa. Identifying, understanding, and tackling the most persistent and climate-damaging trends across sectors is a fundamental concern for research and policy as humanity treads deeper into the Anthropocene.",

    "abstract": "By 2025, biogas is estimated to become a larger part of Indonesia’s energy mix. Biogas is a renewable energy source that also has economic and environmental advantages. Domestic biogas generation has been embraced in Indonesia as a response to the country’s energy security concerns in rural areas. Since the 1970s, 48,038 biogas plants have been built in the region. To fully develop this technology, Indonesia must discontinue relying on fossil fuels and substitute current fossil-fuel-based energy. This article provides an overview of renewable technology in Indonesia, as well as addressing domestic energy demands and referring to existing literature on the socio-technical and socio-economic barriers to biogas adoption in Indonesia. Based on a rigorous review of 71 publications published in Web of Science (WoS) between 2010 and 2021, this study explores existing barriers for biogas adoption by summarizing the current literature from technical, economic, social and environmental perspectives. Biogas adoption is a complex process with many interwoven components. Therefore, this research addresses a gap in the strategic planning and implementation process, providing policymakers with pathways to eliminate bottlenecks in renewable energy planning. Recommendations for future research are also proposed.",

This paper presents the extent of biogas technology adoption by Pakistani rural households and the factors affecting their decision to adopt the technology in three selected districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The data were collected by interviewing 480 respondents by using a pretested and designed questionnaire. The results show that the household adoption rate of biogas technologies is low. The factors affecting the adoption decision of households included household income, access to credit, cultivated land area, the number of cattle in the household, education, and family size. The study also found fundamental barriers to the household adoption of biogas technologies, such as a lack of proper technical services by implementing organizations and insufficient governmental support. The authors make recommendations based on the findings to increase the adoption rate of biogas technologies in rural Pakistan.",

Highly efficient net zero energy (NZE) homes that produce their own electricity from renewable sources are proposed as a solution to reduce energy use and GHG emissions from the residential sector. While the technological and economic feasibility of NZE building in cold climates has been demonstrated, its uptake in Canada has yet to take off. This study analyzes the structural barriers to the adoption of NZE building in lower-income and rural jurisdictions within a developed country. Based on a mixed-methods approach using a quantitative survey and semi-structured interviews, we develop an integrated model that suggests that while market barriers like cost and demand for NZE homes are the most significant, market changes alone cannot guarantee the wide-spread adoption of NZE building. Findings emphasize the key role of the state to instigate energy transition in the building sector, to ensure that NZE building rapidly delivers the necessary emissions reductions, and that the benefits of NZE homes are fairly distributed among all groups.",

    "abstract": "In developing countries, particularly in rural areas, long periods of power outages are experienced as the electricity grid is technically or economically unfeasible. As solar photovoltaic (PV) is the most potential and suitable source of renewable energy for these areas, this paper analyzes the economic viability of its integration in different types of residential buildings. Applying real optionsapproach under uncertainty in electricity prices, this study compares the attractiveness of adopting solar PV over continuing electricity from the grid focusing on various investment payment schemes including (i) full payment, (ii) distributed payment for 5 or 10 years without a down payment, and (iii) distributed payment for 5 or 10 years with 20% or 40% down payment. Applying the model with the case of the Philippines, the resultswith the full payment strategy obtain option values of USD 6888 for building type-I, USD 15349 for building type-II, USD 21204 for building type-III, USD 27870 for building type-IV, and USD 34251 for building type-V. These option values increase by 21.6% and 22.5% with distributed payment scheme to a 5- or 10-year period and increase by 5% and 13% for distributed payment with 40% and 20% down payment. These option values decrease with investments at later periods. Contrary to the conventional option valuation results of an optimal decision to wait, our findings show the otherwise as earlier investment reduces the risk of opportunity loss from delaying the adoption of solar PV. Among the payment schemes analyzed, the distribution of PV system cost in a 10-year installment periodwithout down payment shows to be the most optimal investment strategy which may encourage lower-income and risk-averse consumers whose decision to adopt solar PV is affected by cost barriers, economic status, and household income. The study suggests the government, particularly in developing countries, to support the integration of own-use solar PV in buildings through incentives and subsidies, as well as financial institutions to offer more affordable terms of payment that encourages low to medium income households to adopt solar PV.Further, this will not only augment the energy deficiency in these countries but also support the global aspirations of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and its adverse effects through gradually shifting to renewable sources of energy.",

    "abstract": "Quality in healthcare service is essential in giving rural dwellers a good standard of living. It has been established that many rural locations in Sub-Saharan Africa away from the grid connection have difficulty accessing electricity. The inaccessibility of reliable energy and essential medical equipment was the leading barrier to improved healthcare delivery in these rural locations. The deficiency of basic medical equipment to power essential services due to limited or unreliable electricity access has reduced rural healthcare workers’ care capabilities, resulting in higher mortality rates. This paper, therefore, reviews the existing energy solutions for rural healthcare facilities, thereby analysing different approaches and the geographical energy mix and ascertaining the effectiveness of various techniques and energy mix as solutions to effective healthcare delivery in healthcare centres. Hybrid Renewable Energy Sources (HRES) microsystems, like microgrids incorporated with solar panels and battery, is identified to ensure higher and more reliable energy access in rural healthcare centres. At the same time, the adoption of Demand Side Management (DSM) in the HRES deployment in countryside healthcare facilities is reported to decrease the initial cost of installation and improve efficiency. Lastly, in improving energy access, rural electrification planning is achieved through modelling tools related to energy access modelling.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the major barriers to sustainable rural electrification in the Niger Delta zone and suggests practicable policy pathways to tackle the barriers to the aggressive utilisation of renewable energy technologies in the Niger Delta zone. The barrier to the penetration of renewable energy technologies in the Niger Delta zone can be grouped into policy and institutional, technical, data and information gathering, socio-cultural and behavioural, economic and financial, political and market barrier, and inadequate decision space. The suggested policy pathways are driven from both the energy access and affordability considerations. Potential stakeholders, as the key drivers of the policy pathways, are identified with their various attributes and roles. It is shown that both positive energy policies of the Federal Government of Nigeria towards renewable energy penetration and the support from the oil producing and allied companies towards their operational areas would see the aggressive adoption and assimilation of the renewable energy technologies to meet the energy needs of the Niger Delta zone. This comprehensive paper will serve as a reference for policy players in the quest to address the energy problems in the coastal communities. It is anticipated that policy briefs, directed at the relevant stakeholders, would be crafted in deeper fashion to identify various actors and teasing what can be done in the sustainable energy space.",

This review explores the multifaceted role of renewable energy in driving progress across several SDGs, particularly SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 13 (Climate Action), while also contributing to goals such as poverty alleviation (SDG 1), improved health outcomes (SDG 3), economic growth (SDG 8), and sustainable cities (SDG 11). The transition to renewable energy sources—such as solar, wind, hydropower, and geothermal—offers pathways to reduce global carbon emissions, mitigate climate change, and ensure universal access to clean energy. In addition, renewable energy projects promote economic empowerment through job creation and rural electrification, driving inclusive growth in underserved communities. The integration of renewable energy in urban planning also supports sustainable development in cities. However, the adoption of renewable energy faces barriers such as high initial investment costs, technological limitations, and regulatory challenges. This review discusses strategies to overcome these obstacles, emphasizing the importance of supportive policy frameworks, international cooperation, and public-private partnerships. It highlights successful case studies from countries that have leveraged renewable energy to make significant strides toward the SDGs, offering valuable insights for global implementation. As the world approaches the 2030 deadline for the SDGs, renewable energy remains a vital driver of sustainable development, providing innovative solutions to complex global issues while fostering a cleaner, more equitable future.",

    "abstract": "The study investigates controlled environment agriculture (CEA) in Nigeria focusing on its feasibility, economic benefits, environmental impact, and socio-economic implications. While CEA technologies such as hydroponics, vertical farming, automation, and greenhouse systems offer efficiency and yield improvements, this review highlights the extent to which they can be utilized in solving the food challenges facing the country including food shortages, wasteful use of land, and climatic disturbances in agriculture. However, their adoption faces challenges like high initial costs, technical knowledge gaps, and unstable energy infrastructure. Additionally, there is a lack of localized research on resource utilization, crop profitability, and the scalability of these systems in Nigeria’s urban and rural contexts, which further hinders adoption. Government policy reforms, renewable energy access, and capacity-building programs are crucial to overcoming these barriers. Localized pilot projects and field studies are also necessary to validate the feasibility of CEA systems under Nigeria’s unique socio-economic and climatic conditions. Cross-country comparisons with South Africa and Kenya reveal actionable insights for Nigeria’s CEA implementation such as South Africa’s public-private partnerships and Kenya’s solar-powered vertical farms which can serve as actionable blueprints for Nigeria’s CEA adoption and expansion. Nigeria with its teeming population is food import-dependent, with agricultural imports reaching 3.35 trillion Naira between 2019 and 2023. This is unsustainable and requires alternative measures including targeted CEA interventions to increase its agricultural productivity. Overall, for CEA to contribute meaningfully to the Nigerian agricultural sector, specific changes including targeted subsidies, policy reforms, renewable energy access, stakeholder engagement, capacity-building programs, and infrastructure development must be instituted to achieve sustainable agricultural growth. Furthermore, strategies such as hybridizing traditional and CEA practices and creating “pay-as-you-grow” financial models for CEA infrastructure can make the transition more viable for smallholder farmers, who dominate Nigeria’s agricultural sector.",

    "abstract": "This paper analyses the policies and laws that govern the Nigerian electricity sector to ascertain the opportunities and challenges it presents for addressing the problem of affordability of the initial capital costs and financial sustainability of off-grid renewable electricity (OGRE) faced by private investors. It is argued that the absence of sector-specific targets for OGRE and the preference for gas electricity erode the effectiveness of the policies in enabling laws that will address the mentioned barriers to OGRE development. Analysis of the relevant laws shows that some of the provisions present opportunities for addressing the identified barriers. The latter include the establishment of the Rural Electrification Fund (REF) which provides capital grants to OGRE developers in rural areas, under the Electric Sector Power Reform Act 2005. However, some provisions inflame the identified obstacles to OGRE development, including the expensive licensing fees for OGRE projects and overriding powers of the National Assembly over a State House of Assembly for making laws that cover the sector. Key recommendations are made for the adoption of an overarching renewable energy law that will have some recommended features for addressing the identified barriers to the development of OGRE.",

The development has indeed recorded remarkable growth in most developed countries like China, USA, Brazil, and China. However, this is not the same as most developing countries in Africa. This work carried out a comprehensive review of the available Renewable Energy Sources (RES) in Nigeria, assessed its level of utilization, identified the challenges, and suggested effective ways of ensuring the adoption of a decentralized energy system through the use of RES. A critical analysis of public opinions on the acceptability of RES as a decentralized energy system in the country was carried out. The work sampled the opinions of people in the adoption of RES for a decentralized energy system using southwest, Nigeria as a case study. The population involves power stakeholders, rural dwellers, RES experts, and policymakers across the six states of southwest, Nigeria. A well-structured questionnaire was designed to capture nuanced responses on a range of key parameters, including awareness levels, acceptance, and perceived benefits and challenges associated with decentralized renewable energy systems. The research findings (through the use of questionnaires) showed a very low level of awareness and acceptability of RES and provided valuable insights into the potential barriers and possible facilitating conditions for the adoption of renewable energy technologies.",

Gender interacts with, but is distinct from, the binary categories of biological sex. In this paper we consider how gender interacts with the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, including sustainable development goal (SDG) 3 and its targets for health and well-being, and the impact on health equity. We propose a conceptual framework for understanding the interactions between gender (SDG 5) and health (SDG 3) and 13 other SDGs, which influence health outcomes. We explore the empirical evidence for these interactions in relation to three domains of gender and health: gender as a social determinant of health; gender as a driver of health behaviours; and the gendered response of health systems. The paper highlights the complex relationship between health and gender, and how these domains interact with the broad 2030 agenda. Across all three domains (social determinants, health behaviours and health system), we find evidence of the links between gender, health and other SDGs. For example, education (SDG 4) has a measurable impact on health outcomes of women and children, while decent work (SDG 8) affects the rates of occupation-related morbidity and mortality, for both men and women. We propose concerted and collaborative actions across the interlinked SDGs to deliver health equity, health and well-being for all, as well as to enhance gender equality and women's empowerment. These proposals are summarized in an agenda for action.",

These concerns increase the challenge of gaining an appropriate comprehension of the anthropogenic activities and natural processes, as well as how they influence the quality of surface water and groundwater systems. The characteristics of water resources cause difficulties in the comprehensive assessment regarding the source types, pathways, and pollutants behaviors. As the behavior and prediction of widely known contaminants in the water resources remain challenging, some new issues have developed regarding heavy metal pollutants. The main aim of this review is to focus on certain essential pollutants’ discharge from anthropogenic activities categorized based on land-use sectors such as industrial applications (solid/liquid wastes, chemical compounds, mining activities, spills, and leaks), urban development (municipal wastes, land use practices, and others), and agricultural practices (pesticides and fertilizers). Further, important pollutants released from natural processes classified based on climate change, natural disasters, geological factors, soil/matrix, and hyporheic exchange in the aquatic environment, are also discussed. Moreover, this study addresses the major inorganic substances (nitrogen, fluoride, and heavy metals concentrations). This study also emphasizes the necessity of transdisciplinary research and cross-border communication to achieve sustainable water quality using sound science, adaptable legislation, and management systems.",

Diagnosis must differentiate character traits particular to elite athletes from psychosocial maladaptations. Management strategies should address all contributors to mental health symptoms and consider biopsychosocial factors relevant to athletes to maximise benefit and minimise harm. Management must involve both treatment of affected individual athletes and optimising environments in which all elite athletes train and compete.

No clear evidence of an influence of baseline participant selenium status on outcomes has emerged in these studies.Observational longitudinal studies have shown an inverse association between selenium exposure and risk of some cancer types, but null and direct relations have also been reported, and no systematic pattern suggesting dose-response relations has emerged. These studies suffer from limitations inherent to the observational design, including exposure misclassification and unmeasured confounding.Overall, there is no evidence to suggest that increasing selenium intake through diet or supplementation prevents cancer in humans. However, more research is needed to assess whether selenium may modify the risk of cancer in individuals with a specific genetic background or nutritional status, and to investigate possible differential effects of various forms of selenium.",

    "abstract": "In the era of industrial digitalization, companies are increasingly investing in tools and solutions that allow their processes, machines, employees, and even the products themselves, to be integrated into a single integrated network for data collection, data analysis, the evaluation of company development, and performance improvement. To study the impact of Industry 4.0 on the company we used Porter’s (1985) value chain model, which is particularly useful when paying particular attention to corporate areas which have a primary role in customer value creation. Since the primary impact of Industry 4.0 is perceived in value-creating processes, and has so far had the greatest transformative effect in this area, the model can be considered to be appropriate. The objective of our research is to discover how companies operating in Hungary interpret the phenomenon of Industry 4.0, what Internet of Things (IoT) tools they use to support their processes, and what critical issues they face during adaptation. We applied a dual methodology in our investigation: We sent an online questionnaire to manufacturing and logistical service companies to investigate the IoT tools they use, and the problems they face, and received 43 answers we could evaluate. We also conducted four expert interviews with manufacturing firms to get deeper insights into the application, critical issues and development phases of IoT tools. During our research, we found that the spread of real-time data across companies—given the availability of appropriate analytical tools and methods—can have a significant impact on the entire company. In the case of CPS (Cyber Physical System), CPPS and Big Data Technologies, companies using them have been evaluated as having a higher level of logistic service, more efficient processes with their partners, improved cooperation between certain logistic functions, and higher market and financial performance and competitiveness. Applying more efficient production processes, and achieving better productivity and economies of scale, might also result in increased economic sustainability. Furthermore, we have found that companies have started on the path to digital evolution, and investments of this type have already begun.",

    "abstract": "The excessive use of inorganic fertilizers causes serious environmental degradation, resulting in lower crop yields in Bangladesh. Seventy percent of Bangladesh farmers practice traditional fertilizer broadcasting. In the 1960s, the Bangladesh state authority launched a ‘Grow More Food’ campaign to feed the country’s increasing population. Farmers were supplied with chemical fertilizers and pesticides at a subsidized price. Farmers increased the frequency of fertilizer applications to enhance yields. These practices are still used and have caused significant environmental degradation. In this study, we examined the effects of fertilizer broadcasting on excessive use of fertilizer and environmental risks. We collected data from 211 Bangladesh infield farmers in 2016. Respondents were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed by applying a binary logistic regression model to test the degree of effects between the testable variables. The study found that the effect of broadcasting on the excessive use of fertilizers is strongly significant, at 1%. It also found that younger farmers have a significant effect at 10% on the excessive use of fertilizers. Bangladesh policymakers can formulate policy on sustainable fertilizer management, introducing different placement methods on the basis of this finding. After that, the Directorate of Agricultural Extension (DAE) can carry out the policy at the field level.",

    "abstract": "Injury and illness surveillance, and epidemiological studies, are fundamental elements of concerted efforts to protect the health of the athlete. To encourage consistency in the definitions and methodology used, and to enable data across studies to be compared, research groups have published 11 sport-specific or setting-specific consensus statements on sports injury (and, eventually, illness) epidemiology to date. Our objective was to further strengthen consistency in data collection, injury definitions and research reporting through an updated set of recommendations for sports injury and illness studies, including a new Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist extension. The IOC invited a working group of international experts to review relevant literature and provide recommendations. The procedure included an open online survey, several stages of text drafting and consultation by working groups and a 3-day consensus meeting in October 2019. This statement includes recommendations for data collection and research reporting covering key components: defining and classifying health problems; severity of health problems; capturing and reporting athlete exposure; expressing risk; burden of health problems; study population characteristics and data collection methods. Based on these, we also developed a new reporting guideline as a STROBE Extension—the STROBE Sports Injury and Illness Surveillance (STROBE-SIIS). The IOC encourages ongoing in- and out-of-competition surveillance programmes and studies to describe injury and illness trends and patterns, understand their causes and develop measures to protect the health of the athlete. Implementation of the methods outlined in this statement will advance consistency in data collection and research reporting.",

    "abstract": "Cotton is the second largest crop of Pakistan in terms of area after wheat and is being suffered by multiple shocks over the time due to conventional agricultural management practices, climate change, and market failures. Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) was introduced by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) in 2010, as an innovative cleaner production alternative to conventional farming that aimed at increasing the efficiency of natural resources, resilience, and productivity of agricultural production system, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The adverse effects of climate change on cotton production at the farm and regional level can be minimized by using CSA practices and technologies. The present study investigated the financial performance and explored the impact of CSA through sustainable water use management on cotton production in Lower Bari Doab Canal (LBDC) irrigation system of Punjab, Pakistan by using Cobb-Douglas production function. The adopters of CSA in cotton cultivation were identified by conducting six focus group discussions. Data were collected through well-structured questionnaire from 133 adopters of CSA and 65 conventional cotton growers for the cropping season 2016–2017. It was found that water-smart (raising crops on bed, laser land levelling, conjunctive use of water and drainage management), energy-smart (minimum tillage), carbon-smart (less use of chemicals) and knowledge-smart (crop rotation and improved varieties i.e., tolerant to drought, flood and heat/cold stresses) practices and technologies of CSA were adopted by the cotton farmers in the study area. Most of the farmers were of the view that they are adopting CSA practices and technologies due to the limited supply of canal water, climate change, drought-prone, massive groundwater extraction, rapidly declining groundwater table and increasing soil salinity over the time. Results revealed that uniform germination, higher yield and financial returns, the concentration of inputs and increase in resource use efficiency are the main advantages of CSA. The econometric analysis showed that implementation of CSA practices and technologies as judicious use of water and fertilizer, groundwater quality, access to extension services, and appropriate method and time of picking have a significant impact on the gross value of cotton product (GVP). The findings of the study would be helpful for policy makers to formulate policies that can minimize farmer’s financial burden to adopt CSA technologies and implement for scaling out in Punjab and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Summary The Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region faces a major diet‐related health problem accompanied by enormous economic and social costs. The shifts in diet are profound: major shifts in intake of less‐healthful low‐nutrient‐density foods and sugary beverages, changes in away‐from‐home eating and snacking and rapid shifts towards very high levels of overweight and obesity among all ages along with, in some countries, high burdens of stunting. Diet changes have occurred in parallel to, and in two‐way causality with, changes in the broad food system – the set of supply chains from farms, through midstream segments of processing, wholesale and logistics, to downstream segments of retail and food service (restaurants and fast food chains). An essential contribution of this piece is to marry and integrate the nutrition transition literature with the literature on the economics of food system transformation. These two literatures and debates have been to date largely ‘two ships passing in the night’. This review documents in‐depth the recent history of rapid growth and transformation of that broad food system in LAC, with the rapid rise of supermarkets, large processors, fast food chains and food logistics firms. The transformation is the story of a ‘double‐edged sword’, showing its links to various negative diet side trends, e.g. the rise of consumption of fast food and highly processed food, as well as in parallel, to various positive trends, e.g. the reduction of the cost of food, de‐seasonalization, increase of convenience of food preparation reducing women's time associated with that and increase of availability of some nutritious foods like meat and dairy. We view the transformation of the food system, as well as certain aspects of diet change linked to long‐run changes in employment and demographics (e.g. the quest for convenience), as broad parameters that will endure for the next decades without truly major regulatory and fiscal changes. We then focus in on what are the steps that are being and can be taken to curb the negative effects on diet of these changes. We show that countries in LAC are already among the global leaders in initiating demand‐related solutions via taxation and marketing controls. But we also show that this is only a small step forward. To shift LAC's food supply towards prices that incentivize consumption of healthier diets and demand away from the less healthy component is not simple and will not happen immediately. We must be cognizant that ultimately, food industry firms must be incentivized to market the components of healthy diets. This will primarily need to be via selective taxes and subsidies, marketing controls, as well as food quality regulations, consumer education and, in the medium term, consumers' desires to combine healthier foods with their ongoing quest for convenience in the face of busy lives. In the end, the food industry in LAC will orient itself towards profitable solutions, ie those demanded by the broad mass of consumers.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices (CSAPs) is important for sustaining Indian agriculture in the face of climate change. Despite considerable effort by both national and international agricultural organizations to promote CSAPs in India, adoption of these practices is low. This study aims to examine the elements that affect the likelihood and intensity of adoption of multiple CSAPs in Bihar, India. Design/methodology/approach The probability and intensity of adoption of CSAPs are analyzed using multivariate and ordered probit models, respectively. Findings The results show significant correlations between multiple CSAPs, indicating that their adoptions are interrelated, providing opportunities to exploit the complementarities. The results confirm that both the probability and intensity of adoption of CSAPs are affected by numerous factors, such as demographic characteristics, farm plot features, access to market, socio-economics, climate risks, access to extension services and training. Farmers who perceive high temperature as the major climate risk factor are more likely to adopt crop diversification and minimum tillage. Farmers are less likely to adopt site-specific nutrient management if faced with short winters; however, they are more likely to adopt minimum tillage in this case. Training on agricultural issues is found to have a positive impact on the likelihood and the intensity of CSAPs adoption. Practical implications The major policy recommendations coming from of our results are to strengthen local institutions (public extension services, etc.) and to provide more training on CSAPs. Originality/value By applying multivariate and ordered probit models, this paper provides some insights on the long-standing discussions on whether farmers adopt CSAPs in a piecemeal or in a composite way.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Since 2013, China has implemented a large-scale initiative to systematically deploy solar photovoltaic (PV) projects to alleviate poverty in rural areas. To provide new understanding of China’s targeted poverty alleviation strategy, we use a panel dataset of 211 pilot counties that received targeted PV investments from 2013 to 2016, and find that the PV poverty alleviation pilot policy increases per-capita disposable income in a county by approximately 7%-8%. The effect of PV investment is positive and significant in the year of policy implementation and the effect is more than twice as high in the subsequent two to three years. The PV poverty alleviation effect is stronger in poorer regions, particularly in Eastern China. Our results are robust to alternative specifications and variable definitions. We propose several policy recommendations to sustain progress in China’s efforts to deploy PV for poverty alleviation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Four billion people worldwide have experienced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) confinement. Such unprecedented extent of mobility restriction to curb the COVID-19 pandemic may have profound impacts on how individuals live, travel and retain well-being. This systematic review aims to identify (i) the social consequences of mass quarantine—community-wide movement restrictions—during previous and current infectious disease outbreaks and (ii) recommended strategies to mitigate the negative social implications of COVID-19 lockdowns. Considering social determinants of health, we conducted a systematic review by searching five databases (Ovid-MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and the World Health Organization COVID-19 database) for publications from inception to 9 April 2020. No limitation was set on language, location or study type. Studies that (i) contained peer-reviewed original empirical evidence and (ii) focussed on non-epidemiological implications of mass quarantine were included. We thematically synthesized and reported data due to heterogeneous disease and country context. Of 3067 publications found, 15 original peer-reviewed articles were selected for full-text extraction. Psychological distress, heightened communication inequalities, food insecurity, economic challenges, diminished access to health care, alternative delivery of education and gender-based violence were identified as negative social consequences of community-based quarantine in six infectious disease epidemics, including the current COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, altruistic attitudes were identified as a positive consequence during previous quarantines. Diverse psychological and social consequences of mass quarantine in previous and current epidemics were evident, but individual country policies had been highly varied in how well they addressed the needs of affected individuals, especially those who are socially marginalized. Policymakers should balance the pros and cons of movement restrictions, facilitate multisectoral action to tackle social inequalities, provide clear and coherent guidance to the public and undertake time-bound policy evaluations to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 lockdowns and to establish preparedness strategies for future epidemics.",
