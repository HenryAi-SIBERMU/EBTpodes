    "abstract": "Traditionally, advances in robotic technology have been in the manufacturing industry due to the need for collaborative robots. However, this is not the case in the service sectors, especially in the healthcare sector. The lack of emphasis put on the healthcare sector has led to new opportunities in developing service robots that aid patients with illnesses, cognition challenges and disabilities. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has acted as a catalyst for the development of service robots in the healthcare sector in an attempt to overcome the difficulties and hardships caused by this virus. The use of service robots are advantageous as they not only prevent the spread of infection, and reduce human error but they also allow front-line staff to reduce direct contact, focusing their attention on higher priority tasks and creating separation from direct exposure to infection. This paper presents a review of various types of robotic technologies and their uses in the healthcare sector. The reviewed technologies are a collaboration between academia and the healthcare industry, demonstrating the research and testing needed in the creation of service robots before they can be deployed in real-world applications and use cases. We focus on how robots can provide benefits to patients, healthcare workers, customers, and organisations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we investigate the emerging focal issues of effective cleaning, logistics of patients and supplies, reduction of human errors, and remote monitoring of patients to increase system capacity, efficiency, resource equality in hospitals, and related healthcare environments.",

    "abstract": "In the era of digital data proliferation, agriculture stands on the cusp of a transformative revolution driven by Machine Learning (ML). This study delves into the intricate interplay between Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and conventional agriculture, emphasizing the role of ML in reshaping farming practices. With the ongoing data tsunami impacting data-driven businesses, the fusion of smart farming and precision agriculture emerges as a beacon of innovation. ML algorithms, analyzing historical and real-time environmental data, soil conditioning, predicts suitable crop for maximum yields, detect diseases, and optimize irrigation in smart farming, facilitating informed decision-making. Precision agriculture benefits from autonomous vehicles and drones, driven by ML, ensuring precision in planting, harvesting, and crop monitoring. Resource efficiency increases as ML optimizes energy consumption, manages fertilizer application, and promotes climate-resilient practices. This comprehensive assessment underscores ML&#x2019;s pivotal role in maximizing productivity, minimizing environmental impact, and navigating the complexities of modern agriculture.",

    "abstract": "This present article explores the effects of cultural value, economic prosperity, and community mental wellbeing through multi-sectoral infrastructure growth projects under the Belt and Road Initiative. The implications of the social exchange theory are applied to observe the support of the local community for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). This study explores the CPEC initiative, it’s direct social, cultural, economic development, and risk of environmental factors that affect residents’ lives and the local community’s wellbeing. CPEC is a multibillion-dollar project to uplift economic growth and free trade between Pakistan, China, and other regional stakeholders. Although CPEC is still in its initial phases with partial startups, policymakers and government officials claim this mega project as a “game-changer” in the region, mainly for Pakistan and China. This gigantic project offers the significant potential to generate business slews and employment opportunities with international outreach. Due to the term’s newness, numerous studies have recently explored the macro and microeconomic benefits of the CPEC initiatives; still, these projects are theoretical. The existing literature insufficiently explored how helpful CPEC would be to a specific group and how residents perceive its advantages. This study fills in the literature gaps and explores the likely advantageous potential of the CPEC for the regional states. The study applied a convenient sampling technique for the data collection process. It used a mixed-method approach to gain scientific results, with a standardized questionnaire survey of 459 people (300 men and 159 women) from five major cities of Pakistan. The study results designate that residents believe that CPEC infrastructure projects will significantly improve residents’ life quality through more job openings and community poverty reduction. Still, they raised their concerns regarding environmental protection issues in the region. The findings specified that residents had an optimistic approach to better educational productivity by adopting environment-oriented policies. Policymakers should establish new CPEC study centers in different areas, and investors should be encouraged to participate in the industrial sector. Officials can overwhelm community worries about environmental degradation. Government officials in both countries can utilize the findings to raise public awareness about CPEC’s social, economic, cultural, mental wellbeing, and ecological implications.",

    "abstract": "In the age of the smart city, things like the Internet of Things (IoT) and big data analytics are making big changes to the way traditional structural health monitoring (SHM) is done. Also, the capacity, flexibility, and robustness of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for solving complex real-world problems have led to an increasing interest in applying these methods to SHM systems of infrastructures in recent years. Therefore, an analytical evaluation of recent advancements in SHM for infrastructures appears to be important. The bridge is one of the significant transportation infrastructures where existing environmental and destructive variables can have a negative impact on the structure&#x2019;s life and health. The SHM system for bridges in different stages of their life cycle, such as construction, development, management, and maintenance, is seen as a complementary part of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). The main goal of this study is to look at how AI can be used to improve the current state of the art in data-driven SHM systems for bridges, including conceptual frameworks, advantages, and challenges, as well as existing approaches. This article presents an overview of the role of AI in data-driven SHM systems for bridges in the future. Finally, some potential research possibilities in AI-assisted SHM are also emphasized and detailed.",

    "abstract": "Post-Smart Tourism Destinations (PSTD) need a sense-of-place approach based on uniqueness and thematic differentiation to deliver authentic and valuable experiences. Information and communication technology (ICT), digital technology adoption, sustainable development, community empowerment and local wisdom, and destination uniqueness are keywords that will be further explored in the development of tourism villages in Kenderan as the most important tourism destination development at the village level. The development of smart tourism, proof of the disruption of digital technology in the tourism sector, has become the objective of almost every tourism destination in the world today, be it an urban or rural area. Since its initial emergence, the smart concept in tourism development has evolved. In the beginning, it focused on ICT and the adoption of digital technology. Along with the pressure of the global requirement to apply sustainable development, the focus of smart tourism later included sustainability in the application of smart technology, which made smart tourism development (STD) become smart and sustainable tourism development (SSTD). The post-smart tourism concept arose because many critics suggested that destinations tend to place too much focus on technology adoption and lack attention to local wisdom, inclusivity, and local indigenous aspects of destination development. Applied research implemented mixed methods in the form of qualitative research through expert judgment and quantitative research through structural equation modeling analysis. The results of this research show that creative events for the local aspects of a tourist village, digital competence, and sustainability practice are the building blocks for a post-smart tourism village, while digital competence and sustainable practice have a significant mediating effect of locality on post-smart tourism villages. To ensure a tourism village possesses sustainable competitive advantages, the village must explore and promote its locality aspects to differentiate itself as a tourist village by identifying its valuable, rare, inimitable, and non-substitutable tourism resources. The implication of this research is that to develop wise and distinctive smart tourism destinations, tourist villages should explore their local values and resources, embed them into their basic components and core resources of tourism, and co-create, distribute, deliver, and promote them to the global market through technology adoption and global sustainability value.",

The said factors included population aging, urbanization, household size, per capita GDP, number of vehicles, per capita mutton consumption, education level, and household direct energy consumption structure. Findings were made that the positive effects of urbanization, per capita GDP, per capita mutton consumption and education on carbon emissions were obvious; the number of vehicles had the biggest positive impact on carbon dioxide emissions; and household size and household direct energy consumption structure had a significantly negative impact on carbon emissions. Based on the aforementioned findings, the GA-BP neural network was introduced to predict the carbon emission trend of Xinjiang in 2020-2050. The results reveal that the peak time of the low-carbon scenario was the earliest, between 2029 and 2033. The peak time of the middle scenario was later than low-carbon scenario, between 2032 and 2037, while the peak time of the high-carbon scenario was the latest and was unlikely to reach the peak before 2050.",

The government of Pakistan has similarly made numerous efforts to promote the use of clean energy sources in the rural areas of the country. Therefore, this study examines rural households’ energy choices for cooking and lighting in Pakistan. In doing so, a comprehensive dataset is collected from three different districts of Pakistan between 2020 and 2021, and multivariate probit (MVP) model and Chi-square tests are employed. The Chi-square results indicate that the age, education level, and occupation of the household-head; household size and income; distance to market and wood source; and biogas system ownership are the significant factors affecting cooking choices. The MVP results show that an increase in education level, school-going children, access to credit facilities, and gender (female) are the key positive factors, whereas an increase in the distance to nearest market/road, household size, and age are the factors that negatively affect the likelihood of using clean energy sources for lighting. While comparing the propensity to use modern/clean energy fuels across the three districts, infrastructural development and literacy rate were found to be crucial factors.",

This study assesses the sources and quality of drinking water in Piwoyi community of Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, Nigeria. Thirty-five (35) Boreholes and Two (2) Sachet water were identified sources of drinking water in Piwoyi Community. Six Samples (5 Boreholes and 1Sachet water) were selected at random and analyzed in the laboratory. The Physicochemical parameters examined include electrical conductivity (EC), pH, temperature, turbidity, dissolve oxygen (DO), chloride, total hardness, alkalinity, nitrate, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, phosphorous, sulphate, sodium, potassium, fluoride, bicarbonate, nitrate-nitrogen, nitrite, copper, iron and zinc; and Microbiological parameters include Coliforms, E-coli and Faecal Strep. The results of analysis shows significant concentration of physicochemical and microbiological parameters in the samples of water analyzed according to Nigerian Standard for Drinking Water Quality thereby makes the water unsafe for drinking. Drinking from these sources of water will pose serious health risk to the people of Piwoyi Community. Therefore, the study helps to identify the contaminated locations as well as assist to follow emerging remedial measures toward controlling the contamination source in the community. It also recommends continuous monitoring and enforcement of environmental violations, aggressive sensitization on water sanitation and hygiene; adequate purification of water at domestic level; and government support on potable water supply and establish reasonable management strategies for sustainable water quality protection toward protecting public health.",

    "abstract": "Climate change has caused vulnerability not only to the forest ecosystem but also to forest-dependent communities. Therefore, its management is essential to increase forest ecosystem services and reduce vulnerability to climate change using an integrated approach. Although many scientific studies examined climate change impact on forest ecosystems, forest vulnerability assessment, including forest sensitivity, adaptability, sustainability and effective management was found to be scant in the existing literature. Through a systematic review from 1990 to 2019, this paper examined forest vulnerability to climate change and its management practices. In this paper, descriptive, mechanism and thematic analyses were carried out to analyze the state of existing research, in order to understand the concept of vulnerability arising from climate change and forest management issues. The present study proposed a framework for integrated forest assessment and management for addressing such issues in future research. The conversion of forest land into other land uses, forest fragmentation, forest disturbance and the effects of climate change on the forest ecosystem are the existing problems. Forest vulnerability, effective adaptation to forest ecosystems and long-term sustainability are priority areas for future research. This study also calls for undertaking researchers at a local scale to involve communities for the effective management of forest ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "There has been increasing evidence about mercury (Hg) contamination in traditional populations from the Amazon Basin due to illegal gold mining. The most concerning health impact is neurotoxicity caused by Hg in its organic form: methylmercury (MeHg). However, the severity and extent of the neurotoxic effects resulting from chronic environmental exposure to MeHg are still unclear. We conducted a clinical-epidemiological study to evaluate the neurological impacts of chronic MeHg exposure in Munduruku indigenous people, focusing on somatosensory, motor, and cognitive abnormalities. All participants were subjected to a systemized neurological exam protocol, including Brief Cognitive Screening Battery (BCSB), verbal fluency test, and Stick Design Test. After the examination, hair samples were collected to determine MeHg levels. Data collection took place between 29 October and 9 November 2019, in three villages (Sawré Muybu, Poxo Muybu, and Sawré Aboy) from Sawré Muybu Indigenous Land, Southwest of Pará state. One hundred and ten individuals &gt;12 years old were included, 58 of which were men (52.7%), with an average age of 27.6 years (range from 12 to 72). Participants’ median MeHg level was 7.4 µg/g (average: 8.7; S.D: 4.5; range: 2.0–22.8). In Sawré Aboy village, the median MeHg level was higher (12.5 µg/g) than in the others, showing a significant statistical exposure gradient (Kruskal–Wallis test with p-value &lt; 0.001). Cerebellar ataxia was observed in two participants with MeHg levels of 11.68 and 15.68 µg/g. Individuals with MeHg exposure level ≥10 µg/g presented around two-fold higher chances of cognitive deficits (RP: 2.2; CI 95%: 1.13–4.26) in BCSB, and in the verbal fluency test (RP: 2.0; CI 95%: 1.18–3.35). Furthermore, adolescents of 12 to 19 years presented three-fold higher chances of verbal development deficits, according to the fluency test (RP: 3.2; CI 95%: 1.06–9.42), than individuals of 20 to 24 years. The worsened motor and cognitive functions are suggestive of neurotoxicity due to chronic MeHg exposure. In conclusion, we believe monitoring and follow-up measures are necessary for chronic mercury exposed vulnerable people, and a basic care protocol should be established for contaminated people in the Brazilian Unified Health System.",

    "abstract": "Poverty data are usually collected through on-the-ground household-based socioeconomic surveys. Unfortunately, data collection with such conventional methods is expensive, laborious, and time-consuming. Additional information that can describe poverty with better granularity in scope and at lower cost, taking less time to update, is needed to address the limitations of the currently existing official poverty data. Numerous studies have suggested that the poverty proxy indicators are related to economic spatial concentration, infrastructure distribution, land cover, air pollution, and accessibility. However, the existing studies that integrate these potentials by utilizing multi-source remote sensing and geospatial big data are still limited, especially for identifying granular poverty in East Java, Indonesia. Through analysis, we found that the variables that represent the poverty of East Java in 2020 are night-time light intensity (NTL), built-up index (BUI), sulfur dioxide (SO2), point-of-interest (POI) density, and POI distance. In this study, we built a relative spatial poverty index (RSPI) to indicate the spatial poverty distribution at 1.5 km × 1.5 km grids by overlaying those variables, using a multi-scenario weighted sum model. It was found that the use of multi-source remote sensing and big data overlays has good potential to identify poverty using the geographic approach. The obtained RSPI is strongly correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.71 (p-value = 5.97×10−7) and Spearman rank correlation coefficient = 0.77 (p-value = 1.58×10−8) to the official poverty data, with the best root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.18%. The evaluation of RSPI shows that areas with high RSPI scores are geographically deprived and tend to be sparsely populated with more inadequate accessibility, and vice versa. The advantage of RSPI is that it is better at identifying poverty from a geographical perspective; hence, it can be used to overcome spatial poverty traps.",

    "abstract": "We present the third edition of the complete catalogue of the alien flora of the Czech Republic which follows the 2002 and 2012 editions. It has been updated by incorporating new data collected over the last decade and reassessing the current status of taxa based on improved taxonomic and ecological knowledge. All changes in taxon listing from the 2012 version are documented and explained in an appendix. Based on comprehensive data sources, including the recently developed Pladias database of the Czech flora and vegetation and the Archaeobotanical Database of the Czech Republic, we list 1576 taxa alien to this country, with information on their taxonomic position, life form, geographic origin, residence time status (archaeophyte or neophyte), invasion status (casual, naturalized or invasive), date of the first and last field record, grid-cell occupancy, pathway of introduction into the country, habitat affiliation and impact assessment. This edition includes 122 more taxa than the 2012 edition; 157 taxa were added and 35 were removed; 17 taxa were reclassified as native, eight were removed due to lack of evidence, records of six taxa were assessed as doubtful, and four are not taxonomically justified. The alien flora is recruited from 630 genera and 122 families and comprises 385 archaeophytes and 1191 neophytes; most taxa are casual (1084, i.e. 68.8% of the total number), 417 taxa are naturalized (26.4%), and 75 are invasive (4.8%). The proportion of invasive taxa is almost equal for archaeophytes and neophytes (4.7 and 4.8%, respectively), casual taxa are over-represented among neophytes, and naturalized taxa among archaeophytes. The contribution of alien taxa to the Czech flora is 37.8% if all aliens are considered or 16.2% if all naturalized taxa (including invasives), which are a permanent part of the flora, are included. For all groups of invasion status, the numbers of taxa are increasing over time with no sign of deceleration. Most alien plants originate from the Mediterranean region (618 taxa, i.e. 31.5%), other parts of Europe (380 taxa, 19.4%), other parts of Asia (290 taxa, 14.1%) and North America (262, 13.4%). The highest number of invasive taxa (27, corresponding to 27.6% of all invasive archaeophytes and neophytes) are from North America. Occupancy of grid cells of 10 × 6 arc minutes significantly increases with invasion status and residence time. Invasive taxa are present in more grid cells than naturalized and casual, and archaeophytes occupy on average more grid cells than neophytes in each invasion status category. Maps based on the cumulative record of alien species occurrence over the past 50 years, expressed as the proportion of the entire flora, show that alien species are relatively more prevalent in lowlands and large urban agglomerations. In a European comparison, the Czech Republic is currently a moderately invaded country, but slightly richer in naturalized species than the European average.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the influence of rural labor transfer and its spatial spillover effect on the eco-efficiency of cultivated land use (ECLU) in different regions were investigated using the undesirable super-efficiency epsilon based measure (EBM) and spatial Durbin models and data of 31 Chinese provinces for the period 1990–2018. The results show that: (1) China’s rural labor transfer rate increased; (2) in the east region, the ECLU has exceeded the national average level since 2001. In the west and northeast regions, the ECLU was higher, whereas it remained below the national average level in Central China; (3) in the whole country, west, and northeast regions, the effect of rural labor transfer on the ECLU was first negative and then positive, whereas it was insignificant in East and Central China. In Central, West, and Northeast China, the effect of the labor transfer on the ECLU had significant spatial spillover effects; (4) a significant U-shaped trend was observed between the local labor transfer and ECLU in the whole country, west, and northeast regions. A positive linear correlation was determined for Central China; labor transfer in other regions had significant indirect effects on the ECLU in Central and Northeastern China. In conclusion, China’s rural labor transfer had a significant spatial spillover effect on the ECLU, and differences were observed between East, Central, West, and Northeast China.",

This paper explores the dynamics of livelihood diversification strategies among indigenous women in response to peri-urban development in Wa, Ghana. The mixed-methods design guided the study, while the sample consisted 399 respondents selected from a sample frame of 1494 women. Data analyses involved descriptive statistics, non-parametric and thematic analyses. The study found that peri-urban development had led to the loss of access to farmland among indigenous women. In response, women have resorted to switching from farm-based to non-farm-based livelihoods amidst multiple production challenges.There is, therefore, the need to support the sustainability of women’s livelihoods through the Municipal Assembly and, in particular, through policy interventions such as support for skills training and financial support to enable indigenous people to make a sustainable living.

    "abstract": "Diversifying rural livelihoods plays a significant role for rain feed-dependent economy of the rural households like in Ethiopia. Hence the objective of the study was to investigate the determinants of rural households' livelihood diversification strategies choice in north wollo zone of Ethiopia. A multi-stage stratified random sampling technique was used to select 384 rural household heads as a sample in study areas. Primary data was collected from sample rural household heads using an interview schedule. Multivariate Probit Model was employed to identify the factors influencing the rural household heads' decision to choose livelihood strategies. The model result showed that agriculture livelihood strategy was positively and significantly associated with male headed household, land holding, cooperative membership, and participation in rural productive safety net program; while it is negatively and significantly affected by distance to market. Non-farm livelihood strategy was positively and significantly affected by dependency ratio, education level, total income, and remittance; while it is negatively and significantly affected by the sex of household head and participation in rural productive safety net program. Off-farm livelihood strategy was positively and significantly influenced by sex of household head; while it is negatively and significantly affected by the land holding, total livestock unit, cooperative membership, credit use, participation in rural productive safety net program. Therefore, the study recommends that local government should attempt to promote the above significant determinants of rural households' livelihood diversification strategies choice to build more profitable and sustainable livelihood strategies.",

    "abstract": "The implementation of smart technologies in the tourism industry has become a new trend. This is aimed at enriching tourists’ experiences and improving their satisfaction. The purpose of the present paper is to enhance tourists’ experiences and to increase tourists’ satisfaction using smart technologies and to identify experts’ perspectives regarding the use of these technologies. This research was conducted using quantitative and qualitative research. In the process of data collection, the research involved a questionnaire which focused on tourists’ experiences with various smart technologies and their intentions to return to the visited region. An exploratory factor analysis was applied to determine the elements of satisfaction and their attribute levels in different Romanian touristic regions. This study employed an analysis of variance to determine whether groups with different reasons for visiting exhibit varying levels of satisfaction and whether the touristic regions under investigation generate differing levels of satisfaction. Cross-tabulation and a Pearson’s chi-square test were used to determine whether the tourists’ segment influenced their intention to revisit specific regions. The research was augmented using qualitative research based on the Delphi technique to identify experts’ opinion on the impact of smart tourism technologies on the Romanian tourism industry. This study presents a global perspective on the current situation of smart technologies in the Romanian tourism sector. The results indicate that there is a significant relationship between tourists’ satisfaction and their perception of the value of smart technologies. The use of smart technologies has a positive impact on the experiences of tourists during all phases of their journey. Romania’s tourism capabilities can support the development of smart and sustainable tourism. Smart technologies have a double role in the tourism industry. They can enhance satisfaction by introducing new experiences while also improving the operational efficiency and sustainability of tourist destinations. The use of smart solutions will be essential in creating smooth and unforgettable tourist experiences as the industry develops. Their theoretical and practical implications are deduced. This paper provides valuable information not only for organizational practitioners considering the implementation of smart technology solutions, but also for academics wishing to develop this area of study.",

    "abstract": "LoRa is an ISM‐band based LPWAN communication protocol. Despite their wide network penetration of approximately 20 kilometers or higher using lower than 14 decibels transmitting power, it has been extensively documented and used in academia and industry. Although LoRa connectivity defines a public platform and enables users to create independent low‐power wireless connections while relying on external architecture, it has gained considerable interest from scholars and the market. The two fundamental components of this platform are LoRaWAN and LoRa PHY. The consumer LoRaWAN component of the technology describes the network model, connectivity procedures, ability to operate the frequency range, and the types of interlinked gadgets. In contrast, the LoRa PHY component is patentable and provides information on the modulation strategy which is being utilized and its attributes. There are now several LoRa platforms available. To create usable LoRa systems, there are presently several technical difficulties to be overcome, such as connection management, allocation of resources, consistent communications, and security. This study presents a thorough overview of LoRa networking, covering the technological difficulties in setting up LoRa infrastructures and current solutions. Several outstanding challenges of LoRa communication are presented depending on our thorough research of the available solutions. The research report aims to stimulate additional research toward enhancing the LoRa Network capacity and allowing more realistic installations.",

Likewise, few studies in this research field rely on qualitative data to understand and identify the causative agents for the emotional arousal. This research explores a range of emotions, mixing those that have been widely studied and those that have been hardly analysed. It also looks at the demographic parameters associated with such emotions using a population sample from southern Ecuador. The study analyses quantitative and qualitative data gathered through structured-questionnaires whereby participants were given agency to select and define how they themselves sense emotionally climate change. The results indicate that two of the five participants’ most selected emotions are shared with other nations (‘concern,’ ‘guilt’), while the other three have been less reported and studied in the climate change field (‘powerlessness,’ ‘anger,’ and ‘confusion’). These emotions were found to be aroused by different reasons associated with specific demographic variables. The findings reveal the role of the cultural and local environment in the emotional arousal and its relevance for designing more effective climate communication campaigns.",

    "abstract": "The development and integration of industries have promoted economic growth and gradually become an important perspective to understand the country’s modernized construction. The cultural industry and the tourism industry are naturally coupled, which is an important part of the process of industrial integration. In addition, the country’s drive towards modernization needs to improve the overall level of industrial integration, and rural revitalization is one of the key links to this. Therefore, to explore the relationship between the integration of cultural tourism industry and rural revitalization, this study collected the panel data of 31 provincial-level regions in China from 2005 to 2021. Based on the entropy method and the coupling coordination degree model, this study constructs an evaluation index system, including cultural industry, tourism industry, the integration of cultural tourism industry, new urbanization, and rural revitalization, and obtains the comprehensive scores of each. Furthermore, the study discusses the path selection and future development direction of rural revitalization through the integration of a cultural tourism industry. The conclusions are drawn as follows: (1) The development of the cultural and tourism industries can significantly promote the development of new urbanization and rural revitalization; (2) the integration of cultural tourism industry has a positive effect on rural revitalization; (3) new urbanization plays a partial mediating role in the relationship between the integration of cultural tourism industry and rural revitalization; (4) new urbanization has a masking effect on the influence of the integration of cultural tourism industry on rural revitalization; and (5) the extent of these effects varies by region. Finally, this study not only deepens the understanding of rural revitalization from the perspective of industrial development and integration, but also provides an empirical basis for the country, local governments, and enterprises to promote rural revitalization.",

In this paper, using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Landsat satellite remote sensing images, based on the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, we carried out remote sensing classification to obtain a year-by-year land use/cover data set in Vietnam over the past 21 years (2000–2020). Further applying principal component analysis and multiple linear regression methods, we examined the spatio-temporal characteristics, dynamic changes and driving mechanisms of land use change. The results show the following: (1) The RF classification algorithm supported by the GEE can quickly and accurately obtain a land use/cover data set. The overall classification accuracy is 0.91 ± 0.01. (2) The land cover types in Vietnam are dominated by woodland and cropland, with an area share of 54.62% and 37.90%, respectively. In the past 20 years, the area of built-up land has increased the most (+93.49%), followed by the area of water bodies (+54.19%), while the area of woodland has remained almost unchanged. (3) The expansion of built-up land is driven by regional economic development; the area changes in cropland, water bodies and woodland are influenced by both national economic development and climate change. The results of the study provide a basis for assessing land use policies in Vietnam and a reference methodological framework for rapid land mapping and analysis in other countries in the China–Indochina Peninsula.",

    "abstract": "With rapid rural urbanization and new rural construction, the commercial energy consumption of rural residents shows a trend of rapid growth, and China’s rural areas are also faced with environmental challenges brought by the increase of commercial energy consumption. China’s commercial energy consumption behavior of rural residents has also undergone tremendous changes. However, scholars have neglected the research on rural residents’ commercial energy consumption intention from a micro perspective. Therefore, this study takes the 5 villages in Chengdu out of the 100 representative villages in the Sichuan province as examples. From the perspective of the head of a family of permanent rural residents, extended planned behavior theory, exploratory factor analysis, and structural equation modeling are used to explore the influencing factors of rural resident commercial energy consumption intention and their relationship. Findings show that subjective norm, perceived behavioral control (PBC), and habit significantly affect residents’ behavioral intention. Habits significantly influence subjective norms and PBC. Therefore, in the new rural construction, rural residents are the main body and participants of energy consumption. Local government departments should plan reasonably according to the needs and characteristics of residents, constantly improve commercial energy infrastructure, improve service level, and further strengthen farmers’ attitude and satisfaction toward commercial energy. Moreover, they should increase the publicity and education of commercial energy, advocate green housing, and promote energy saving consumption reduction, and sustainable development in new rural areas.",

Although the individual or background effects of multilevel influencing factors have been considered in some previous studies, the spatial effects of these factors are rarely involved. By considering nested geographic and administrative features and integrating the detection of individual, background, and spatial effects, a bilevel hierarchical spatial linear model (HSLM) is established in this study to identify the multilevel significant factors that cause poverty in poor villages, as well as the mechanisms through which these factors contribute to poverty at both the village and county levels. An experimental test in the region of the Wuling Mountains in central China revealed the following findings. (1) There were significant background and spatial effects in the study area. Moreover, 48.28% of the overall difference in poverty incidence in poor villages resulted from individual effects at the village level. Additionally, 51.72% of the overall difference resulted from background effects at the county level. (2) Poverty-causing factors were observed at different levels, and these factors featured different action mechanisms. Village-level factors accounted for 14.29% of the overall difference in poverty incidence, and there were five significant village-level factors. (3) The hierarchical spatial regression model was found to be superior to the hierarchical linear model in terms of goodness of fit. This study offers technical support and policy guidance for village-level regional development.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Urbanization leads to the construction of various urban infrastructures in the city area for residency, transportation, industry, and other purposes, which causes major land use change. Consequently, it substantially affects Land Surface Temperature (LST) by unbalancing the surface energy budget. Higher LST in city areas decreases human thermal comfort for the city dwellers and affects the urban environment and ecosystem. Therefore, a comprehensive investigation is needed to evaluate the impact of land use change on the LST. Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques were used for the detailed investigation. RS data for the years 1993, 2007 and 2020 during summer (March–May) in Dhaka city were used to prepare land cover maps, analyze LST, generate hazard maps and relate the land cover change with LST by using GIS. The results show that the built-up area in Dhaka city increased by 67% from 1993 to 2020 by replacing lowland mainly, followed by vegetation, bare soil and water bodies. LSTs found in the study area were ranged from 23.26 to 39.94 °C, 23.69 to 43.35 °C and 24.44 to 44.58 °C for the years 1993, 2007 and 2020, respectively. The increases of spatially distributed maximum and mean LST were found 4.62 °C and 6.43 °C, respectively, for the study period of 27 years while the change in minimum LST was not substantial. LST increased by around 0.24 °C per year and human thermal discomfort shifted from moderate to strong heat stress for the total study period due to the increase of built-up and bare lands. This study also shows that normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI) were negatively correlated with LST while normalized difference built-up Index (NDBI) and normalized difference built-up Index (NDBAI) were positively correlated with LST. The methodology developed in this study can be adapted to other cities around the globe.",

    "abstract": "Increasingly people, especially those residing in urban areas with the urban heat island effect, are getting exposed to extreme heat due to ongoing global warming. A number of methods have been developed, so far, to assess urban heat vulnerability in different locations across the world concentrating on diverse aspects of these methods. While there is growing literature, thorough review studies that compare, contrast, and help understand the prospects and constraints of urban heat vulnerability assessment methods are scarce. This paper aims to bridge this gap in the literature. A systematic literature review with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) approach is utilized as the methodological approach. PRISMA is an evidence-based minimum set of items for reporting in systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The results are analyzed in three aspects—i.e., indicators and data, modelling approaches, and validation approaches. The main findings disclose that: (a) Three types of indicators are commonly used—i.e., demographic properties and socioeconomic status, health conditions and medical resources, and natural and built environmental factors; (b) Heat vulnerability indexing models, equal weighting method, and principal component analysis are commonly used in modelling and weighting approaches; (c) Statistical regressions and correlation coefficients between heat vulnerability results and adverse health outcomes are commonly used in validation approaches, but the performance varies across studies. This study informs urban policy and generates directions for prospective research and more accurate vulnerability assessment method development.",

    "abstract": "Flash floods are the most dangerous kinds of floods because they combine the destructive power of a flood with incredible speed. They occur when heavy rainfall exceeds the ability of the ground to absorb it. The main aim of this study is to generate flash flood maps using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Frequency Ratio (FR) models in the river’s floodplain between the Jhelum River and Chenab rivers. A total of eight flash flood-causative physical parameters are considered for this study. Six parameters are based on remote sensing images of the Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS), Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and Sentinel-2 Satellite, which include slope, elevation, distance from the stream, drainage density, flow accumulation, and land use/land cover (LULC), respectively. The other two parameters are soil and geology, which consist of different rock and soil formations, respectively. In the case of AHP, each of the criteria is allotted an estimated weight according to its significant importance in the occurrence of flash floods. In the end, all the parameters were integrated using weighted overlay analysis in which the influence value of drainage density was given the highest weight. The analysis shows that a distance of 2500 m from the river has values of FR ranging from 0.54, 0.56, 1.21, 1.26, and 0.48, respectively. The output zones were categorized into very low, low, moderate, high, and very high risk, covering 7354, 5147, 3665, 2592, and 1343 km2, respectively. Finally, the results show that the very high flood areas cover 1343 km2, or 6.68% of the total area. The Mangla, Marala, and Trimmu valleys were identified as high-risk zones of the study area, which have been damaged drastically many times by flash floods. It provides policy guidelines for risk managers, emergency and disaster response services, urban and infrastructure planners, hydrologists, and climate scientists.",

The haze risk assessment indexes of 11 cities in Fenwei Plain were selected from three aspects: the sensitivity of disaster-inducing environments, haze component hazards and the vulnerability of disaster-bearing bodies, combined with regional disaster system theory. The haze hazard risk levels of 11 cities in Fenwei Plain were evaluated using the matter-element extension (MEE) model, and the indicator weights were determined by improving the principal component analysis (PCA) method using the entropy weight method, and finally, five haze hazard risk assessment models were established by improving the particle swarm optimization (IPSO) light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) algorithm. It is used to assess the risk of affected populations, transportation damage risk, crop damage area risk, direct economic loss risk and comprehensive disaster risk before a disaster event occurs. The experimental comparison shows that the haze risk index of Xi’an city is the highest, and the full index can improve the evaluation accuracy by 4–16% compared with only the causative factor index, which indicates that the proposed PCA-MEE-ISPO-LightGBM model evaluation results are more realistic and reliable.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Water Quality Index (WQI) is a unique and effective rating technique for assessing the quality of water. Nevertheless, most of the indices are not applicable to all water types as these are dependent on core physico-chemical water parameters that can make them biased and sensitive towards specific attributes including: (i) time, location and frequency for data sampling; (ii) number, variety and weights allocation of parameters. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate these indices to eliminate uncertainties that make them unpredictable and which may lead to manipulation of the water quality classes. The present study calculated five WQIs for two temporal periods: (i) June to December 2019 obtained in real time (using the Internet of Things (IoT) nodes) at inlet and outlet streams of Rawal Dam; (ii) 2012–2019 obtained from the Rawal Dam Water Filtration Plant, collected through GIS-based grab sampling. The computed WQIs categorized the collected datasets as ‘Very Poor’, primarily owing to the uneven distribution of the water samples that has led to class imbalance in the data. Additionally, this study investigates the classification of water quality using machine learning algorithms namely: Decision Tree (DT), k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression (LogR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Naive Bayes (NB); based on the parameters including: pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, turbidity, fecal coliform and temperature. The classification results showed that the DT algorithm outperformed other models with a classification accuracy of 99%. Although WQI is a popular method used to assess the water quality, there is a need to address the uncertainties and biases introduced by the limitations of data acquisition (such as specific location/area, type and number of parameters or water type) leading to class imbalance. This can be achieved by developing a more refined index that considers various other factors such as topographical and hydrological parameters with spatial temporal variations combined machine learning techniques to effectively contribute in estimation of water quality for all regions.",

    "abstract": "Droughts are the most destructive catastrophes in the world. The persistence of drought is considered to cause many challenges for both humans and animals and ruins the ecosystem. These challenges have encouraged scientists to search for innovative methods and models that are effective for assessing and predicting drought events. The use of drought indices has been extensively employed in many regions across the globe and their effectiveness demonstrated. This review illustrates the effectiveness of drought indices in the assessment of droughts, with a focus on drought management and mitigation measures. Additionally, several ways of managing drought risk and proactive strategies that need to be implemented to mitigate droughts have been illustrated. In conclusion, this article suggests that drought mitigation should be done more naturally, in ways that strongly protect the environment rather than involve engineering projects which might cause the degradation of rivers and land, and damage the ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Ecological environment quality and resilience assessment is an important prerequisite for ensuring the coordination and stability of socio-economic development and eco-environment protection. Remote sensing technology has provided new approaches for quantitatively evaluating regional ecological environment quality and resilience rapidly, accurately, and objectively. Taking the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREBML) as an example, to assess ecological environment quality, this study calculated the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) based on the Google Earth Engine using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data with a spatial resolution of 500 m during 2000–2020. An evaluation index to assess ecological resilience and its spatial pattern based on the RSEI of 2000–2020 was then constructed. The evaluation index was constructed from two dimensions, including the sensitivity and adaptability of the RSEI. Finally, this study identified key factors that affect ecological residence based on a structural equation model. The results showed that the overall RSEI was at moderate and good levels in the YREBML during 2000–2020, accounting for more than 85% of the total area. Its spatial characteristics showed that the RSEI was higher in the middle reaches than in the lower reaches of the YREB, and higher in the south than in the north. The overall RSEI in the YREBML showed a decreasing trend during 2000–2020, with 54.36% of the region improving and 45.64% declining. Areas with declining RSEI were concentrated in Anhui, while the increasing RSEI was observed in Zhejiang. In addition, the spatial pattern of ecological resilience was characterized by high resilience in the north and east, and low resilience in the south and west. High resilience areas accounted for 40.48% of the YREBML, mainly contributed by Jiangxi and Hunan provinces. The driving factors analysis results indicated that economic development, natural disaster risk, and environmental pollution would further affect ecological resilience of urban systems. This study provides more scientific and effective data support for ecological environment monitoring and governance.",

    "abstract": "Assessing the magnitude of smallholder farmers’ livelihood vulnerability to drought is an initial step in identifying the causal factors and proposing interventions that mitigate the impacts of drought. This study aimed to assess smallholders’ livelihood vulnerability to the drought in the upper Awash sub-basin, Ethiopia. Household (HH) and climate data were used for indicators related to sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity that define vulnerability to drought. The vulnerability of farmers’ livelihood to drought was compared among the studies agroecological zone (AEZ) and farm typologies. The result illustrated a diverse magnitude of vulnerability index (VI) ranging from −1.956 to −4.253 for AEZ. The highest magnitude of VI was estimated for livelihood in the lowland AEZ, while the lowest magnitude of VI was estimated in midland AEZ. This could be accounted for by the fact that lowland farmers shown the highest exposure (0.432) and sensitivity (0.420) and the lowest adaptive capacity (0.288). A closer look at farmers’ livelihood typology, in each of the AEZ, showed substantial diversity of farmers’ livelihood vulnerability to drought, implying potential aggregations at AEZ. Accordingly, the vulnerability index for livestock and on-farm-income-based livelihood and marginal and off-farm-income-based livelihood typologies were higher than the intensive-irrigation-farming-based smallholders’ livelihood typology. Based on the result, we concluded that procedures for smallholders’ livelihood resilience-building efforts should better target AEZ to prioritize the focus region and farmers’ livelihood typology to tailor technologies to farms. Although the result emphasizes the importance of irrigation-based livelihood strategy, the overall enhancement of farmers adaptive capacity needs to focus on action areas such as reducing the sensitivity and exposure of the households, improving farmers usage of technologies, diversify farmers’ livelihood options, and, hence, long-term wealth accumulation to strengthen farmers’ adaptive capacity toward drought impacts.",

The scientific and reasonable prediction of water inrush in mines with complex hydrogeological conditions is of great significance to the safe and efficient operation of coal mines. Taking the roof water inrush problem of the No. 3 lower coal seam in the Jisan Coal Mine as the research object, the factors affecting the roof water inrush of the coal seam were comprehensively considered from three aspects: the aquifer property, the mining fracture development and the geological structure. The evaluation index system was constructed by selecting 10 factors, including the aquifer depth and thickness, core recovery rate, brittle–plastic rock thickness ratio, number of water-resisting layers, development height of the water-conducting fracture zone, fault density, frequency density, scale index and variation coefficient of the coal seam floor dip angle. At the same time, based on the dual influence of subjective and objective weighting, the scientific and reasonable weight of each factor was ensured. The AHP-CRITIC composite weighting method was used to calculate the comprehensive weight of each factor. Finally, the roof water inrush risk prediction model was constructed. According to the prediction results, the study area was divided into a low-risk area, medium-risk area and high-risk area. Compared with the actual situation, the prediction results were basically consistent with the actual situation, and the prediction results can provide the basis for the prevention and control of water in a coal mine.",

This research aimed to guide landscape management and decision-making by developing an evaluation framework to construct ecological security patterns. Taking the Jianghan Plain as the study area, we identified key ecological sources by overlaying the spatial patterns of ecological quality (biodiversity, carbon storage, and water yield) and ecological sensitivity (habitat sensitivity, soil erosion sensitivity, and water sensitivity) using the Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model and the Chinese Soil Loss Equation Function. Ecological corridors were obtained by the least-cost path analysis method and circuit theory. A total of 48 ecological sources (3812.95 km2), primarily consisting of water area, forestland, and cropland, were identified. Ninety-one ecological corridors were derived, with a total length of 2036.28 km. Forty barriers and 40 pinch points with the highest improvement coefficient scores or priority scores were selected. There were 11 priority corridors with very high levels of connectivity improvement potential and conservation priority, occupying 16.15% of the total length of corridors. The overall potential for ecological connectivity is high on the Jianghan Plain. Our framework offers a valuable reference for constructing ecological security patterns and identifying sites for ecological restoration at the regional scale.",

As the backbone of urban systems, physical components, including buildings, transportation networks, communication networks, and open and green spaces, are also vulnerable to disasters. To enhance the capacity to deal with disaster risks, enhancing urban resilience has recently become an essential priority for cities. This study aims to develop and pilot test a framework to evaluate urban physical resilience based on resilience characteristics and associated physical indicators. Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) was used to determine the relationships between physical indicators, and Multi-Criteria Decision-Making methods were applied to determine the relative importance of the characteristics. The results showed that the ‘Robustness of Building’, ‘Building Density’, ‘Aspect Ratio’, and ‘Street Width’ are the most important among the twenty physical indicators considered in the proposed framework. Subsequently, the proposed framework was applied to one of the districts of Kerman, a major city located in the southwest, earthquake-prone part of Iran. Overall results indicate low levels of physical resilience. The findings of this study can provide urban planners and decision-makers with more transparent and practical insights into the physical resilience of cities. Results can also be used to design and implement policies and programs to improve the current conditions.",

It was revealed that China and the USA were the most studied countries and those that had the most first author affiliations. The most prominent research topic was the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI), while the research topics related to climate change were underrepresented. MODIS was by far the most used sensor system, followed by Landsat. A relatively small number of studies analyzed LST dynamics on a global or continental scale. The extensive use of MODIS highly determined the study periods: A majority of the studies started around the year 2000 and thus had a study period shorter than 25 years. The following suggestions were made to increase the utilization of LST time series in climate research: The prolongation of the time series by, e.g., using AVHRR LST, the better representation of LST under clouds, the comparison of LST to traditional climate change measures, such as air temperature and reanalysis variables, and the extension of the validation to heterogenous sites.",

    "abstract": "With the background of climate change and intensified human activities, environmental problems are becoming increasingly prominent on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). For the development of efficient environmental policies and protection measures, quick and accurate assessments of the spatiotemporal patterns in ecological vulnerability are crucial. Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, we used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and human footprint (HFP) datasets to analyze the spatiotemporal distributions and main driving factors of the remote sensing ecological vulnerability index (RSEVI) for the QTP. Moreover, spatial autocorrelation analysis and the standard deviational ellipse (SDE) were used to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics. Our results showed that the RSEVI gradually increased from the southeast to the northwest of the QTP. From 2000 to 2018, the potential vulnerability area increased by 6.59 × 104 km2, while the extreme vulnerability area decreased by 1.84 × 104 km2. Moran’s I value of the RSEVI was greater than 0 and increased, indicating that the aggregation degree was increasing. The gravity center was located in Nagqu, Tibet, and shifted to the northwest from 2000 to 2015 and to the southeast from 2015 to 2018. The SDE rotated in a counterclockwise direction. The three most important driving factors of ecological vulnerability were wetness, land surface temperature (LST), and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), indicating that climate and vegetation were the dominant factors. Moreover, this study developed a promising method for the ecological vulnerability assessment of large-scale and long time series datasets, and it provides theoretical support for the ecological conservation and sustainable development of the QTP under global change.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain presents a chance to address the security and privacy issues of the Internet of Things; however, blockchain itself has certain security issues. How to accurately identify smart contract vulnerabilities is one of the key issues at hand. Most existing methods require large-scale data support to avoid overfitting; machine learning (ML) models trained on small-scale vulnerability data are often difficult to produce satisfactory results in smart contract vulnerability prediction. However, in the real world, collecting contractual vulnerability data requires huge human and time costs. To alleviate these problems, this paper proposed an ensemble learning (EL)-based contract vulnerability prediction method, which is based on seven different neural networks using contract vulnerability data for contract-level vulnerability detection. Seven neural network (NN) models were first pretrained using an information graph (IG) consisting of source datasets, which then were integrated into an ensemble model called Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection method based on Information Graph and Ensemble Learning (SCVDIE). The effectiveness of the SCVDIE model was verified using a target dataset composed of IG, and then its performances were compared with static tools and seven independent data-driven methods. The verification and comparison results show that the proposed SCVDIE method has higher accuracy and robustness than other data-driven methods in the target task of predicting smart contract vulnerabilities.",

    "abstract": "Recently, locust outbreaks around the world have destroyed agricultural and natural vegetation and caused massive damage endangering food security. Unusual heavy rainfalls in habitats of the desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria) and lack of monitoring due to political conflicts or inaccessibility of those habitats lead to massive desert locust outbreaks and swarms migrating over the Arabian Peninsula, East Africa, India and Pakistan. At the same time, swarms of the Moroccan locust (Dociostaurus maroccanus) in some Central Asian countries and swarms of the Italian locust (Calliptamus italicus) in Russia and China destroyed crops despite developed and ongoing monitoring and control measurements. These recent events underline that the risk and damage caused by locust pests is as present as ever and affects 100 million of human lives despite technical progress in locust monitoring, prediction and control approaches. Remote sensing has become one of the most important data sources in locust management. Since the 1980s, remote sensing data and applications have accompanied many locust management activities and contributed to an improved and more effective control of locust outbreaks and plagues. Recently, open-access remote sensing data archives as well as progress in cloud computing provide unprecedented opportunity for remote sensing-based locust management and research. Additionally, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems bring up new prospects for a more effective and faster locust control. Nevertheless, the full capacity of available remote sensing applications and possibilities have not been exploited yet. This review paper provides a comprehensive and quantitative overview of international research articles focusing on remote sensing application for locust management and research. We reviewed 110 articles published over the last four decades, and categorized them into different aspects and main research topics to summarize achievements and gaps for further research and application development. The results reveal a strong focus on three species—the desert locust, the migratory locust (Locusta migratoria), and the Australian plague locust (Chortoicetes terminifera)—and corresponding regions of interest. There is still a lack of international studies for other pest species such as the Italian locust, the Moroccan locust, the Central American locust (Schistocerca piceifrons), the South American locust (Schistocerca cancellata), the brown locust (Locustana pardalina) and the red locust (Nomadacris septemfasciata). In terms of applied sensors, most studies utilized Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre VEGETATION (SPOT-VGT), Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) as well as Landsat data focusing mainly on vegetation monitoring or land cover mapping. Application of geomorphological metrics as well as radar-based soil moisture data is comparably rare despite previous acknowledgement of their importance for locust outbreaks. Despite great advance and usage of available remote sensing resources, we identify several gaps and potential for future research to further improve the understanding and capacities of the use of remote sensing in supporting locust outbreak- research and management.",

    "abstract": "Climate change (CC) is a significant concern for many climate-sensitive socio-economic sectors, such as agriculture and food production. The current study aimed at analyzing the current vulnerability of the Moroccan agricultural sector to CC and anthropogenic impact and identifying the relevant vulnerability factors in the Beni Mellal-Khénifra region. In this regard, a multidisciplinary approach was used to assess the vulnerability. To do this, an index based on five components was designed, including climate, plant production, animal production, geography, and anthropogenic aspects. The numerical model has benefited from data retrieved from three recognized indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), and from the reported data of the agricultural, environmental, and socio-economic governmental departments. The results showed that there was a significant vulnerability of all the five components to CC. Particularly, the province of Azilal was the most vulnerable, followed by Khénifra, Fquih Ben Salah, and Beni Mellal, while Khouribga was the least vulnerable. These components might help to determine the mechanisms and priority sectors, the most vulnerable to CC and anthropogenic effects, to take urgent measures. These may guide decision makers to carry out effective actions, namely, the amounts to be spent to mitigate this vulnerability. It will also make it possible to know where, when, and how the adaptation should take place.",

    "abstract": "The greatest sustainability challenge facing humanity today is the greenhouse gas emissions and the global climate change with fossil fuels led by coal, natural gas and oil contributing 61.3% of global electricity generation in the year 2020. The cumulative effect of the Stockholm, Rio, and Johannesburg conferences identified sustainable energy development (SED) as a very important factor in the sustainable global development. This study reviews energy transition strategies and proposes a roadmap for sustainable energy transition for sustainable electricity generation and supply in line with commitments of the Paris Agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and limiting the rise in global average temperature to 1.5°C above the preindustrial level. The sustainable transition strategies typically consist of three major technological changes namely, energy savings on the demand side, generation efficiency at production level and fossil fuel substitution by various renewable energy sources and low carbon nuclear. For the transition remain technically and economically feasible and beneficial, policy initiatives are necessary to steer the global electricity transition towards a sustainable energy and electricity system. Large-scale renewable energy adoption should include measures to improve efficiency of existing nonrenewable sources which still have an important cost reduction and stabilization role. A resilient grid with advanced energy storage for storage and absorption of variable renewables should also be part of the transition strategies. From this study, it was noted that whereas sustainable development has social, economic, and environmental pillars, energy sustainability is best analysed by five-dimensional approach consisting of environmental, economic, social, technical, and institutional/political sustainability to determine resource sustainability. The energy transition requires new technology for maximum use of the abundant but intermittent renewable sources a sustainable mix with limited nonrenewable sources optimized to minimize cost and environmental impact but maintained quality, stability, and flexibility of an electricity supply system. Technologies needed for the transition are those that use conventional mitigation, negative emissions technologies which capture and sequester carbon emissions and finally technologies which alter the global atmospheric radiative energy budget to stabilize and reduce global average temperature. A sustainable electricity system needs facilitating technology, policy, strategies and infrastructure like smart grids, and models with an appropriate mix of both renewable and low carbon energy sources.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite enormous challenges in accessing sustainable energy supplies and advanced energy technologies, Ethiopia has one of the world's fastest growing economies. The development of renewable energy technology and the building of a green legacy in the country are being prioritized. The total installed capacity for electricity generation in Ethiopia is 4324.3 MW as on October, 2018. Renewable energy accounts for 96.5% of total generation; however, despite the county's enormous biomass energy potential, only 0.58% of power is generated using biomass. Ethiopia has surplus woody biomass, crop residue and animal dung resources which comprise about 141.8 million metric tons of biomass availability per year. At present the exploited potential is about 71.9 million metric tons per year. This review paper provides an in-depth assessment of Ethiopia's biomass energy availability, potential, challenges, and prospects. The findings show that, despite Ethiopia's vast biomass resource potential, the current use of modern energy from biomass is still limited. As a result, this study supports the use of biomass-based alternative energy sources without having a negative impact on the socioeconomic system or jeopardizing food security or the environment. This finding also shows the challenges, opportunities and possible solutions to tackle the problem to expand alternative energy sources. The most effective techniques for producing and utilizing alternate energy sources were also explored. Moreover, some perspectives are given based on the challenges of using efficient energy production and sustainable uses of biomass energy in Ethiopia as it could be also implemented in other developing countries. We believe that the information in this review will shed light on the current and future prospects of biomass energy deployment in Ethiopia.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays the pace of production and consumption is reaching environmentally unsustainable levels. In this regard, the great technological advances developed in recent years are postulated as a source of opportunities to boost the circular economy and sustainable development. This wide range of possibilities offered by new technologies to create a more sustainable reality has aroused the curiosity and interest of the academic world, especially in recent years. The main objective of this research is to reveal the main challenges and opportunities that arise when incorporating new technologies to the objectives of the circular economy. Regarding to the methodology, this study has been partially supported using bibliometric techniques. The results highlight the transformative role of new technologies, especially blockchain and artificial intelligence, in advancing the circular economy, with particular emphasis on the community and technology integration, ethical considerations, technological synergies, sustainable business models, and the burgeoning bioeconomy. We conclude that new technologies promise enhanced resource efficiency, optimized supply chains, innovative business models, and improved product lifecycle management, offering profound economic and environmental benefits while fostering sustainable consumption and collaborative innovation. However, these opportunities also represent the main challenges to address, such as integrating advanced production methods, ensuring supply chain transparency, overcoming the skill gap, avoiding data centralization, and adapting regulatory frameworks to foster equitable and sustainable growth. These are some of the most important areas for further research, especially those related to the development of employees' technological capabilities and the adaptation of regulatory frameworks, as they are understudied research gaps.",

This study used data from all villages in Indonesia and is the most comprehensive study in Indonesia to address the knowledge gap between VF allocation and SDGs by analyzing the distribution of the use of the VF. The objectives of this paper are: (1) to provide the extent of VF usage to provide evidence on whether this utilization was aligned with the targeted SDGs, and (2) to provide information regarding village activities funded by the VF that were linked to each SDG. The results from this analysis can be used to encourage the Government to socialize and provide an understanding of SDGs to village leaders. Moreover, since Indonesia has developed Village SDGs, which are based on national SDG targets and localization of global SDGs to adapt to local culture as well as social and environmental conditions, it is recommended that other developing countries could formulate similar strategies to help achieve their national SDG targets and to develop rural areas in a more targeted way by prioritizing the most relevant issues. The study shares lessons learned from Indonesian experience in managing fiscal policy to more than 70,000 autonomous villages through the village fund program in the last five years.",

The results reveal that (1) the digital economy can significantly improve the green development level of China’s agriculture; the dividends in the eastern region and central region are significantly higher than that in the western region, and there is regional heterogeneity. (2) The role of the digital economy in promoting agricultural green development has a nonlinear characteristic of increasing “marginal effect.” (3) The digital economy has a significant spatial spillover effect, which can have a positive impact on agricultural green development in the surrounding areas. (4) The construction of “Broadband Countryside” can improve the development of the rural digital economy and indirectly promote agricultural green development. This study deepens our understanding of the internal effect and interval relationship of how the digital economy enables agricultural green development and provides the theoretical basis and practical suggestions for optimizing digital facility construction and high-quality agricultural development.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The diverse aquaculture sector makes important contributions toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)/Agenda 2030, and can increasingly do so in the future. Its important role for food security, nutrition, livelihoods, economies, and cultures is not clearly visible in the Agenda 21 declaration. This may partly reflect the state of development of policies for aquaculture compared with its terrestrial counterpart, agriculture, and possibly also because aquaculture production has historically originated from a few key hotspot regions/countries. This review highlights the need for better integration of aquaculture in global food system dialogues. Unpacking aquaculture's diverse functions and generation of values at multiple spatiotemporal scales enables better understanding of aquaculture's present and future potential contribution to the SDGs. Aquaculture is a unique sector that encompasses all aquatic ecosystems (freshwater, brackish/estuarine, and marine) and is also tightly interconnected with terrestrial ecosystems through, for example, feed resources and other dependencies. Understanding environmental, social, and economic characteristics of the multifaceted nature of aquaculture provides for more context‐specific solutions for addressing both opportunities and challenges for its future development. This review includes a rapid literature survey based on how aquaculture links to the specific SDG indicators. A conceptual framework is developed for communicating the importance of context specificity related to SDG outcomes from different types of aquaculture. The uniqueness of aquaculture's contributions compared with other food production systems are discussed, including understanding of species/systems diversity, the role of emerging aquaculture, and its interconnectedness with supporting systems. A selection of case studies is presented to illustrate: (1) the diversity of the aquaculture sector and what role this diversity can play for contributions to the SDGs, (2) examples of methodologies for identification of aquaculture's contribution to the SDGs, and (3) trade‐offs between farming systems’ contribution to meeting the SDGs. It becomes clear that decision‐making around resource allocation and trade‐offs between aquaculture and other aquatic resource users needs review of a wide range of established and emergent systems. The review ends by highlighting knowledge gaps and pathways for transformation that will allow further strengthening of aquaculture's role for contributing to the SDGs. This includes identification and building on already existing monitoring that can enable capturing SDG‐relevant aquaculture statistics at a national level and discussion of how a cohesive and comprehensive aquaculture strategy, framed to meet the SDGs, may help countries to prioritize actions for improving well‐being.",

    "abstract": "Can farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) boost crop yields and improve food availability without using more mineral fertilizer? This question has been at the center of lively debates among the civil society, policy-makers, and in academic editorials. Proponents of the “yes” answer have put forward the “input reduction” principle of agroecology, i.e. by relying on agrobiodiversity, recycling and better efficiency, agroecological practices such as the use of legumes and manure can increase crop productivity without the need for more mineral fertilizer. We reviewed decades of scientific literature on nutrient balances in SSA, biological nitrogen fixation of tropical legumes, manure production and use in smallholder farming systems, and the environmental impact of mineral fertilizer. Our analyses show that more mineral fertilizer is needed in SSA for five reasons: (i) the starting point in SSA is that agricultural production is “agroecological” by default, that is, very low mineral fertilizer use, widespread mixed crop-livestock systems and large crop diversity including legumes, but leading to poor soil fertility as a result of widespread soil nutrient mining, (ii) the nitrogen needs of crops cannot be adequately met solely through biological nitrogen fixation by legumes and recycling of animal manure, (iii) other nutrients like phosphorus and potassium need to be replaced continuously, (iv) mineral fertilizers, if used appropriately, cause little harm to the environment, and (v) reducing the use of mineral fertilizers would hamper productivity gains and contribute indirectly to agricultural expansion and to deforestation. Yet, the agroecological principles directly related to soil fertility—recycling, efficiency, diversity—remain key in improving soil health and nutrient-use efficiency, and are critical to sustaining crop productivity in the long run. We argue for a nuanced position that acknowledges the critical need for more mineral fertilizers in SSA, in combination with the use of agroecological practices and adequate policy support.",

Based on the new development philosophy of the Chinese government, this study constructs an evaluation framework of \"innovation-coordination-green-openness-sharing\" for high-quality agricultural development, and quantitatively assesses the level of high-quality agricultural development in China's Yangtze River Economic Belt with a systematic integration model, and explores the spatial evolution characteristics and obstacles of the level of high-quality agricultural development in Yangtze River Economic Belt. It reveals that the level of high-quality agricultural development in the Yangtze River Economic Belt shows a fluctuating upward trend in general, but there is variability among regions. The green dimension has the fastest development rate, followed by innovation and sharing. In terms of spatial characteristics, it gradually shows a pattern dominated by high levels and shows the characteristics of agglomeration, but the spatial correlation is not high. In terms of obstacle factors, openness and coordination are the main obstacle factors. Considering the different agricultural development models, it is suggested that international cooperation, new agricultural cooperation, and differentiated policies can be considered to promote high-quality agricultural development. This study provides a more complete evaluation framework for government policy-making authorities to measure the level of regional agricultural development and help regional agriculture achieve sustainable development at a higher quality level.",

Since, 2007 agroforestry has received attention in global climate discussions for its carbon sink potential. Agroforestry plays a defining role in offsetting greenhouse gases, providing sustainable livelihoods, localizing Sustainable Development Goals and achieving biodiversity targets. The review explores evidence of agroforestry systems for human well-being along with its climate adaptation and mitigation potential for South Asia. In particular, we explore key enabling and constraining conditions for mainstreaming agroforestry systems to use them to fulfill global climate mitigation targets. Nationally determined contributions submitted by South Asian countries to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change acknowledge agroforestry systems. In 2016, South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation’s Resolution on Agroforestry brought consensus on developing national agroforestry policies by all regional countries and became a strong enabling condition to ensure effectiveness of using agroforestry for climate targets. Lack of uniform methodologies for creation of databases to monitor tree and soil carbon stocks was found to be a key limitation for the purpose. Water scarcity, lack of interactive governance, rights of farmers and ownership issues along with insufficient financial support to rural farmers for agroforestry were other constraining conditions that should be appropriately addressed by the regional countries to develop their preparedness for achieving national climate ambitions. Our review indicates the need to shift from planning to the implementation phase following strong examples shared from India and Nepal, including carbon neutrality scenarios, incentives and sustainable local livelihood to enhance preparedness.",

This article constructed an evaluation index system of 25 indicators for common prosperity, covering four dimensions of material wealth, harmonious social life, rich spiritual life, and livable ecological environment. The TOPSIS method was used to comprehensively rank nine provinces and two municipalities in the Yangtze River Economic Belt. The results show that the level of common prosperity along the Yangtze River Economic Belt increased significantly from 2010 to 2019, and the level of common prosperity in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River Economic Belt is much higher than that in the middle and upper reaches. According to the differences in common prosperity levels among regions, provinces and cities are divided into three categories: high, unbalanced, and low. Combined with the characteristics of each type of region, policy suggestions were put forward from the perspectives of strengthening the regional industrial cooperation mechanism, deepening the construction of regional livelihood infrastructure and basic public services, and improving the ability of regional environmental coordination.",

    "abstract": "Sustainable agriculture is crucial to the United Nations’ efforts to promote the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, to develop successful policies and strategies, it is necessary to assess the many obstacles to implementing sustainable agriculture. This study uses Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques to analyze the challenges and opportunities facing sustainable agriculture in China’s economy, particularly in advancing the SDGs. Three enormous obstacles are found in the study, along with fifteen smaller ones that are broken down into economic, social, and environmental categories. The weights of the obstacles and sub-barriers are determined, and the solutions for sustainable agriculture are ranked using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) methodologies. According to the AHP approach, economic issues are China’s most significant obstacles to sustainable agriculture, followed by environmental and social concerns. Climate change and a lack of financial incentives are the two highest-ranked sub-barriers. On the other hand, the SAW approach suggests that the best ways to achieve the SDGs through sustainable agriculture are through international cooperation, financial investments in sustainable agriculture, and alternative agricultural methods. In order to advance sustainable agriculture and the SDGs in China, the report advises policymakers to focus on strengthening institutional support, increasing public awareness, and making technological investments.",

The construction of digital villages is currently in the stage of experimentation and exploration; China is the largest developing country and a pioneer in the digitization of villages. (2) Methods: Based on a combination of the Boston Consulting Group Matrix and GeoDetector, we conducted an empirical study on 70 counties in Guangxi, aiming to analyze the construction level, evolution model, and driving mechanism of digital villages and to provide a basis for decisions on government investment and social participation. (3) Results: First, Conspicuous disequilibrium in rural digitalization has manifested in Guangxi, and counties at different levels (leader, follower, and straggler) show significant clustering and correlation effects in their geographical distribution. Second, digital village construction in Guangxi has evolves in diversified modes (divided into four types: star, gazelle, cow, and dog), with hot and cold areas forming a center–periphery structure. Third, rural digitalization has a very complex driving mechanism, with high heterogeneity in the direct influencing factors, significant synergistic enhancement of factors, and nonlinear enhancement dominating the interaction’s relationship. (4) Conclusions: According to the results of analysis, we suggest highlighting the government-driven mechanism and regional linkage in the construction of digital villages, formulating differentiated management policies and development plans based on the combination of top-level design and grassroots innovation, establishing joint meetings or development associations and service alliances, and stimulating the enthusiasm of the whole of society, especially farmers and enterprises, in order to achieve rapid and sustainable rural digitalization.",

In recent years, however, rural development has experienced global crises, such as issues in public education, health care, roads, water and sanitation, along with environmental pollution and a lack of natural resources. It is therefore important to promote rural revitalization in the process of modernization. To objectively reveal the current research status in the field of rural revitalization, we analyzed relevant publications in the Web of Science from 1991 to 2021. The results are as follows: (1) In the past 30 years, the number of publications on rural vitalization has increased, and the period from 1991 to 2021 can be divided into three stages, the initial period (1991–2004), the development period (2005–2016), and the high-yield period (2017–2021). (2) Research on rural revitalization covered 60 countries or regions around the world, involving a total of 3099 authors. China, the United States, and Canada published most of the articles. (3) High-frequency keywords were migration, management, and urbanization, indicating that scientists considered the role of sustainable urban and rural development, policy formulation, and urbanization. We highlight that for the development of the field of rural vitalization, scientists need to further strengthen theoretical research, fully absorb the development achievements of advanced countries and regions, understand the laws and trends of urban and rural development in their own countries, and explore new paths to achieve rural vitalization.",

Three different environments hosting active and passive solar energy systems (existing urban areas, new urban areas, and agricultural/rural areas) have been investigated to attain lessons learned and recommendations. Findings suggest that (a) it is important to consider solar energy from the early stages of the design process onwards to achieve satisfactory levels of integration; (b) a higher level of awareness regarding solar potential at the beginning of a project permits acting on its morphology, achieving the best solution in terms of active and passive solar gains; (c) when properly designed, photovoltaic systems can act as characterizing elements and as a distinctive architectural material that is able to valorize the aesthetic of the entire urban intervention; (d) further significant outcomes include the importance of supporting the decision strategies with quantitative and qualitative analyses, the institution of coordinating bodies to facilitate the discussion between stakeholders, and the need for deep renovation projects to fully impact existing buildings’ stock; (e) when large solar installations are planned at the ground level, a landscape design approach should be chosen, while the ecological impact should be reduced by carefully planning the adoption of alternative solutions (e.g., agrivoltaics) compatible with the existing land use.",

The Japanese government has declared its aim at achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. The concept of zero-energy buildings (ZEBs) is based on measures to reduce energy consumption in buildings, the prospects of which are gradually increasing. This study investigated the annual primary energy consumption; as well as evaluated, renewed, and renovated buildings that had a solar power generation system, and utilized solar and geothermal heat. It further examines the prospects of hydrogen production from on-site surplus electricity and the use of hydrogen fuel cells. A considerable difference was observed between the actual energy consumption (213 MJ/m2), and the energy consumption estimated using an energy simulation program (386 MJ/m2). Considerable savings of energy were achieved when evaluated based on the actual annual primary energy consumption of a building. The building attained a near net zero-energy consumption considering the power generated from the photovoltaic system. The study showed potential energy savings in the building by producing hydrogen, using surplus electricity from on-site power generation, and introducing hydrogen fuel cells. It is projected that a building’s energy consumption will be lowered by employing the electricity generated by the hydrogen fuel cell for standby power, water heating, and regenerating heat from the desiccant system.",

    "abstract": "From the perspective of energy consumption optimization, this paper studies the impact of green finance on carbon emissions in China. Firstly, based on the theoretical perspective, this paper explores the mechanism and path by which green finance influences carbon emissions, and analyzes the role of energy consumption in this process. Then, this paper utilizes the STIRPAT model, chain multiple mediation effect model and panel threshold model to empirically analyze the influence of green finance on carbon emissions, using provincial data from China from 2005 to 2019. The results are as follows: (1) Green finance significantly reduces carbon emissions. After accounting for potential endogeneity, this conclusion is still valid. The heterogeneity test reveals that the inhibitory effect is more remarkable in northern regions, high-carbon emission regions and energy-rich regions. (2) The results of the bootstrap test reveal that at the national level, green finance decreases carbon emissions through three paths: green technological innovation, ecological evolution of the industrial structure and green technological innovation facilitating ecological evolution of the industrial structure. Furthermore, in energy-rich regions, green finance significantly inhibits carbon emissions through all three paths, while in energy-poor regions, green finance reduces carbon emissions only through green technological innovation. (3) There is a nonlinear relationship between green finance and carbon emissions. Specifically, regardless of energy intensity or energy consumption structure, only when it is below the threshold can green finance significantly inhibit carbon emissions. Thus, realizing energy consumption optimization is an effective way to ensure the carbon emission reduction effect of green finance.",

The goal of adopting sustainable development models is vigorously pursued in the European Union and is reflected concretely in the new Common Agricultural Policy 2023-2027. The circular economy can certainly be an emerging economic response that can effectively replace growth models centered on a linear view. Agriculture and tourism are two crucial sectors where the “green transition” should be encouraged to help achieve sustainability goals through economic circularity. Agritourism's activity may be relevant in contributing to a behavioral change based on ethical choices. The study aim is to find out if agritourism can be the forerunner for the green transition. The objective is to know motivations and current level of awareness and adoption of concrete behaviors of the circular economy by agritourisms and their guests. The tourists' preferences for Sicilian agritourism offerings were also observed. Methods Two types of surveys were conducted: a Census of the Sicilian Agritourisms active at an online travel agency and a sampling survey of the agritourism's visitors. Results and discussion The results showed that agritourism by its very nature carries the green transition, partly due to the enormous financial support of the new CAP. Second, it is a provider of quality food and ecosystem services, and a promoter of healthy behaviors and consumption of seasonal and local short-chain products by visitors, so it can be a vehicle for the adoption of the Mediterranean Diet as a sustainable lifestyle and food system. Tourists' propensity to seek out environmentally friendly products and green services can help to improve ethical, responsible, and sustainable tourism. A sustainable behavioral model for farmers and tourists was provided.",

    "abstract": "The paper analyzes the impact of energy consumption on the three pillars of sustainable development in 74 countries. The main methodological challenge in this research is the choice of a single integral indicator for assessing the social component of sustainable development. Disability-adjusted life year (DALY), ecological footprint, and GDP (Gross domestic product) are used to characterize the social, ecological, and economical pillars. The concept of physics, namely the concept of density (specific gravity), is used. It characterizes the ratio of the mass of a substance to its volume, i.e., reflects the saturation of a certain volume with this substance. Thus, to assess the relationship between energy consumption and the three foundations of sustainable development, it is proposed to determine the energy density of the indicators DALY, the ecological footprint, and GDP. The reaction to changes in energy consumption is described by the elasticity of energy density functions, calculated for each of the abovementioned indicators. The state of the social pillar is mostly dependent on energy consumption. As for the changes in the ecological pillar, a 1% reduction in energy consumption per capita gives only a 0.6% ecological footprint reduction, which indicates a low efficiency of reducing energy consumption policy and its danger for the social pillar. The innovative aspect of the research is to apply a cross-disciplinary approach and a calculative technique to identify the impact that each of the pillars of sustainable development imposes on energy policy design. The policy of renewable energy expansion is preferable for all sustainable development pillars.",

    "abstract": "The residual slurry obtained from the anaerobic digestion (AD) of biogas feed substrates such as livestock dung is known as BGS. BGS is a rich source of nutrients and bioactive compounds having an important role in establishing diverse microbial communities, accelerating nutrient use efficiency, and promoting overall soil and plant health management. However, challenges such as lower C/N transformation rates, ammonia volatilization, high pH, and bulkiness limit their extensive applications. Here we review the strategies of BGS valorization through microbial and organomineral amendments. Such cohesive approaches can serve dual purposes viz. green organic inputs for sustainable agriculture practices and value addition of biomass waste. The literature survey has been conducted to identify the knowledge gaps and critically analyze the latest technological interventions to upgrade the BGS for potential applications in agriculture fields. The major points are as follows: (1) Bio/nanotechnology-inspired approaches could serve as a constructive platform for integrating BGS with other organic materials to exploit microbial diversity dynamics through multi-substrate interactions. (2) Advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS) pave an ideal pathway to study the complex microflora and translate the potential information into bioprospecting of BGS to ameliorate existing bio-fertilizer formulations. (3) Nanoparticles (NPs) have the potential to establish a link between syntrophic bacteria and methanogens through direct interspecies electron transfer and thereby contribute towards improved efficiency of AD. (4) Developments in techniques of nutrient recovery from the BGS facilities' negative GHGs emissions and energy-efficient models for nitrogen removal. (5) Possibilities of formulating low-cost substrates for mass-multiplication of beneficial microbes, bioprospecting of such microbes to produce bioactive compounds of anti-phytopathogenic activities, and developing BGS-inspired biofertilizer formulations integrating NPs, microbial inoculants, and deoiled seed cakes have been examined.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. Disastrous bushfires during the last months of 2019 and January 2020 affected Australia, raising the question to what extent the risk of these fires was exacerbated by anthropogenic climate change. To answer the question for southeastern Australia, where fires were particularly severe, affecting people and ecosystems, we use a physically based index of fire weather, the Fire Weather Index; long-term observations of heat and drought; and 11 large ensembles of state-of-the-art climate models. We find large trends in the Fire Weather Index in the fifth-generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Atmospheric Reanalysis (ERA5) since 1979 and a smaller but significant increase by at least 30 % in the models. Therefore, we find that climate change has induced a higher weather-induced risk of such an extreme fire season. This trend is mainly driven by the increase of temperature extremes. In agreement with previous analyses we find that heat extremes have become more likely by at least a factor of 2 due to the long-term warming trend. However, current climate models overestimate variability and tend to underestimate the long-term trend in these extremes, so the true change in the likelihood of extreme heat could be larger, suggesting that the attribution of the increased fire weather risk is a conservative estimate. We do not find an attributable trend in either extreme annual drought or the driest month of the fire season, September–February. The observations, however, show a weak drying trend in the annual mean. For the 2019/20 season more than half of the July–December drought was driven by record excursions of the Indian Ocean Dipole and Southern Annular Mode, factors which are included in the analysis here. The study reveals the complexity of the 2019/20 bushfire event, with some but not all drivers showing an imprint of anthropogenic climate change. Finally, the study concludes with a qualitative review of various vulnerability and exposure factors that each play a role, along with the hazard in increasing or decreasing the overall impact of the bushfires.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. PurpleAir sensors, which measure particulate matter (PM), are widely used by individuals, community groups, and other organizations including state and local air monitoring agencies. PurpleAir sensors comprise a massive global network of more than 10 000 sensors. Previous performance evaluations have typically studied a limited number of PurpleAir sensors in small geographic areas or laboratory environments. While useful for determining sensor behavior and data normalization for these geographic areas, little work has been done to understand the broad applicability of these results outside these regions and conditions. Here, PurpleAir sensors operated by air quality monitoring agencies are evaluated in comparison to collocated ambient air quality regulatory instruments. In total, almost 12 000 24 h averaged PM2.5 measurements from collocated PurpleAir sensors and Federal Reference Method (FRM) or Federal Equivalent Method (FEM) PM2.5 measurements were collected across diverse regions of the United States (US), including 16 states. Consistent with previous evaluations, under typical ambient and smoke-impacted conditions, the raw data from PurpleAir sensors overestimate PM2.5 concentrations by about 40 % in most parts of the US. A simple linear regression reduces much of this bias across most US regions, but adding a relative humidity term further reduces the bias and improves consistency in the biases between different regions. More complex multiplicative models did not substantially improve results when tested on an independent dataset. The final PurpleAir correction reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) of the raw data from 8 to 3 µg m−3, with an average FRM or FEM concentration of 9 µg m−3. This correction equation, along with proposed data cleaning criteria, has been applied to PurpleAir PM2.5 measurements across the US on the AirNow Fire and Smoke Map (https://fire.airnow.gov/, last access: 14 May 2021) and has the potential to be successfully used in other air quality and public health applications.",

    "abstract": "As cities expand, human mobility has become a central focus of urban planning and policy making to make cities more inclusive and sustainable. Initiatives such as the “15-minutes city” have been put in place to shift the attention from monocentric city configurations to polycentric structures, increasing the availability and diversity of local urban amenities. Ultimately they expect to increase local walkability and increase mobility within residential areas. While we know how urban amenities influence human mobility at the city level, little is known about spatial variations in this relationship. Here, we use mobile phone, census, and volunteered geographical data to measure geographic variations in the relationship between origin-destination flows and local urban accessibility in Barcelona. Using a Negative Binomial Geographically Weighted Regression model, we show that, globally, people tend to visit neighborhoods with better access to education and retail. Locally, these and other features change in sign and magnitude through the different neighborhoods of the city in ways that are not explained by administrative boundaries, and that provide deeper insights regarding urban characteristics such as rental prices. In conclusion, our work suggests that the qualities of a 15-minutes city can be measured at scale, delivering actionable insights on the polycentric structure of cities, and how people use and access this structure.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitous presence of microplastics in bivalve mollusks and related risks have raised particular concerns. In this study, the available data on the abundance and polymer type of microplastics in bivalves from twenty-two countries were extracted to comprehensively understand the risks of microplastics in bivalves. Following the data from 52 peer-reviewed papers, the abundance, chemical composition, and human exposure risks of microplastics of bivalves among countries were initially assessed. Abundance risk results indicated that bivalves from 22 countries presented a low pollution load index, showing a lower risk level (level I). The polymer risk index (H) of bivalves from Portugal (Hcountry = 1335, level IV) and India (Hcountry = 1187, level IV) were higher than the other countries due to the occurrence of hazardous microplastics, such as polyvinyl chloride. For the human exposure risks, the global mean value of microplastic exposure to humans via mollusk consumption is estimated to be 751 microplastics/capita/year, with the maximum intake by the Chinese. This study suggests that abundance risk may be a fundamental indicator for assessing the potential hazard to humans until the chemical composition risks are confirmed. This study is the first attempt to assess the potential risks of microplastics in bivalves using three evaluation models based on microplastic abundances and polymer types, which will contribute to establishing future human health risk assessment frameworks. These findings will also assist efforts in policy-making to minimize microplastic risks in seafood.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Medical services inevitably generate healthcare waste (HCW) that may become hazardous to healthcare staffs, patients, the population, and the atmosphere. In most of the developing countries, HCW disposal management has become one of the fastest-growing challenges for urban municipalities and healthcare providers. Determining the location for HCW disposal centers is a relatively complex process due to the involvement of various alternatives, criteria, and strict government guidelines about the disposal of HCW. The objective of the paper is to introduce the WASPAS (weighted aggregated sum product assessment) method with Fermatean fuzzy sets (FFSs) for the HCW disposal location selection problem. This method combines the score function, entropy measure, and classical WASPAS approach within FFSs context. Next, a combined procedure using entropy and score function is proposed to estimate the criteria weights. To do this, a novel score function with its desirable properties and some entropy measures are introduced under the FFSs context. Further, an illustrative case study of the HCW disposal location selection problem on FFSs is established, which evidences the practicality and efficacy of the developed approach. Comparative discussion and sensitivity analysis are made to monitor the permanence of the introduced framework. The final results approve that the proposed methodology can effectively handle the ambiguity and inaccuracy in the decision-making procedure of HCW disposal location selection.",

Due to the noise and conflict, redundancy, and inconsistency of big time-series data, the forecasting accuracy may reduce on the contrary. This paper proposes a deep network by selecting and understanding data to improve performance. Firstly, a data self-screening layer (DSSL) with a maximal information distance coefficient (MIDC) is designed to filter input data with high correlation and low redundancy; then, a variational Bayesian gated recurrent unit (VBGRU) is used to improve the anti-noise ability and robustness of the model. Beijing’s air quality and meteorological data are conducted in a verification experiment of 24 h PM2.5 concentration forecasting, proving that the proposed model is superior to other models in accuracy.",

To test these hypotheses for 115 countries clustered as high, middle, and low income over the period of 2000 to 2015, system generalized method of moments is employed. The results show that an improvement in governance increases environmental quality in high income countries, while it decreases environmental quality in middle- and low-income countries. We concluded that high-income countries should improve governance structures to get better environmental outcomes without changing their environment-oriented policies and governance practices, and middle- and low-income countries should bring in structural changes to their governance systems by prioritizing environmental outcomes over economic outcomes for improving environmental quality.",

Sustainable agricultural practices, such as reduced tillage, growing cover crops, and implementing crop residue retention measures, have been proposed as cost-effective solutions that can address land degradation, food security, and climate change mitigation and adaptation by enhancing soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration in soils and its associated co-benefits. In this regard, extensive research has demonstrated that conservation agriculture (CA) improves soil physical, chemical, and biological properties that are crucial for maintaining soil health and increasing agroecosystem resilience to global change. However, despite the research that has been undertaken to implement the three principles of CA (minimum mechanical soil disturbance, permanent soil organic cover with crop residues and/or cover crops, and crop diversification) worldwide, there are still many technical and socio-economic barriers that restrict their adoption. In this review, we gather current knowledge on the potential agronomic, environmental, and socio-economic benefits and drawbacks of implementing CA principles and present the current agro-environmental policy frameworks. Research needs are identified, and more stringent policy measures are urgently encouraged to achieve climate change mitigation targets.",

In addition, the popularization of the concept of a circular economy (CE) used to retain goods, components, and materials at their highest usability and value at all times, illustrates the importance of the adequate performance of reverse logistics (RL) processes. However, traditional RL is unable to cope with the requirements of modern supply chains and requires the application of Industry 4.0 technologies, which would make it more efficient. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the applicability of various Industry 4.0 technologies in the RL sector in order to point out the most applicable ones. To solve the defined problem, a novel multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) model was defined by combining the best—worst method (BWM) to obtain the criteria weights, and the newly developed comprehensive distance-based ranking (COBRA) method to rank the technologies. Another aim of the study was to validate the newly established method. The results indicated that the most applicable technologies were the Internet of Things, cloud computing, and electronic—mobile marketplaces. These technologies will have a significant impact on the development of RL and the establishment of CE systems, thus bringing about all the related positive effects.",

Specifically, abnormal returns associated with these mispricing signals are greater for stocks held more by SR institutions. The link between SR ownership and the efficacy of mispricing signals only emerges in recent years with the rise of ESG investing, and is significant only when there are arbitrage-related funding constraints.",

Therefore, this study examines the relationship between carbon dioxide (CO2) emission and the inflation rate in the construction industry of Malaysia and proposes a CO2 emission calculator framework. As it is not possible to calculate the effect directly, therefore, an indirect assessment of the correlation coefficient was performed between the inflation rate (independent variable) and construction rates, i.e., building material prices and value of construction work (dependent variables) along with percentage deviation of each variable. The results show that with a decrease in the inflation rate, the prices of the building materials also decrease, whereas the value of the construction work increases. The relationship looks attractive from an end-user perspective, but it creates a major problem of CO2 emission. The effect impacts directly on environmental sustainability as it is not suitable for the greenhouse effect because it triggers CO2 emission. While estimating how much CO2 emission occurs from the value of construction work of Malaysia, it was revealed that there is no such calculator available to perform the estimation. Therefore, a CO2 emission calculator framework is proposed, which will be beneficial after its practical implementation for the construction industry stakeholders and government/policy makers to monitor the emissions and control the adverse effects of massive construction work.",

Therefore, this study aims to provide a practical framework for the selection decisions of final measures and policies to be carried out to achieve SUMP workspace goals using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methodology. Alternatives are created with the strategic “pillar”, which was first adopted by the Podgorica city council. With the measurements in this pillar, the main criteria and the recommended measures for these measures create sub-criteria. Secondly, a Fuzzy Full Consistency Method (F-FUCOM) was used to determine the weights of the main and sub-criteria. The Fuzzy Combined Compromise Solution (F-CoCoSo) method was then applied to rank the alternatives. “The implementation and assurance of the SUMP” and “establishing a system for regular data collection, monitoring and evaluation of selected mobility indicators” were decided as the most important main and sub-criteria with weights of 0.286 and 0.1079, respectively. The findings suggest that the comprehensive planning for sustainable urban mobility alternative is first and the valorization of cycling potential alternative is second. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis confirms the validity, robustness, and effectiveness of the proposed framework. The applied methodology has the potential to assist decision makers in the process of developing SUMPs.",

Besides the health-related aspects, represented by environmental health risk perception and functional health literacy, we considered social and demographic characteristics (gender, area of residence, sources of information, trust in institutional and non-institutional subjects, and students’ capacity of positive actions, indicated as internal locus of control). The attitudes towards pro-environmental behaviors were positive for more than 70% of students and positively related with health risk perception, internal locus of control, and health literacy. The correspondence between the positive attitudes towards pro-environmental behaviors and the real adoption of such behaviors was approximately 20% for most behaviors, except for the separate collection of waste (60%). Such a discrepancy can be attributable to external obstacles (i.e., lack of time, costs, lack of support). The health-related aspects were linked to the pro-environmental attitudes, but to a lesser extent to pro-environmental behaviors, owing to the complexity of their determinants. However, they should be taken in account in planning education interventions.",

Although the literature review has evaluated and benchmarked these applications, data ambiguity and vagueness continue to be unresolved issues. The robustness of the fuzzy decision by opinion score method (FDOSM) and fuzzy weighted with zero inconsistency (FWZIC) is proven compared with that of other MADM methods. Thus, this study extends FDOSM and FWZIC under a new fuzzy environment to address the mentioned issues whilst benchmarking the applications. The neutrosophic fuzzy set is used for this purpose because of its high ability to handle ambiguous and vague information comprehensively. Fundamentally, the proposed methodology comprises two phases. The first phase adopts and describes the decision matrices of the smart e-tourism applications. The second phase presents the proposed framework in two sections. In the first section, the weight of each attribute of smart e-tourism applications is calculated through the neutrosophic FWZIC (NS-FWZIC) method. The second section employs the weights determined by the NS-FWZIC method to benchmark all the applications per each category (tourism marketing and smart-based tourism recommendation system categories) through the neutrosophic FDOSM (NS-FDOSM). Findings reveal that: (1) the NS-FWZIC method effectively weights the applications’ attributes. Real time receives the highest importance weight (0.402), whereas augmented reality has the lowest weight (0.005). The remaining attributes are distributed in between. (2) In the context of group decision-making, NS-FDOSM is used to uniform the variation found in the individual benchmarking results of the applications across all categories. Systematic ranking, sensitivity analysis and comparison analysis assessments are used to evaluate the robustness of the proposed work. Finally, the limitations of this study are discussed along with several future directions.",

    "abstract": "Accurately recognizing potential failures in the early stages of providing products or services can prevent the loss of investment and time and reduce the risk of safety hazards. Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) is a conventional approach for detecting and prioritizing the probable failures of a product&#x2019;s design or production process. Nevertheless, the traditional risk priority number (RPN) method has come under criticism for its deficiencies. This paper proposes a modified FMEA method based on fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques to cope with the weaknesses of the previous methodologies and improve the primary method. The concept of spherical fuzzy sets (SFS) is utilized to address the vagueness and impreciseness of the information that allows the experts to have more freedom in making decisions by including membership, non-membership, and hesitation of fuzzy sets. Initially, the procedure of assigning weights to the RPN criteria is implemented with SFS step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA). Then, the failure modes are ranked by the SFS combined compromise solution (CoCoSo) method. The effectiveness and practicality of the suggested approach are illustrated through a case study on the Manjil wind farm in Iran. Results show that the suggested model is more reliable and realistic to be utilized in the prioritization of failures than the common FMEA method or other integrated MCDM approaches.",

    "abstract": "The ambient air quality in a city is heavily influenced by meteorological conditions. The city of Siliguri, known as the \"Gateway of Northeast India\", is a major hotspot of air pollution in the Indian state of West Bengal. Yet almost no research has been done on the possible impacts of meteorological factors on criterion air pollutants in this rapidly growing urban area. From March 2018 to September 2022, the present study aimed to determine the correlations between meteorological factors, including daily mean temperature (℃), relative humidity (%), rainfall (mm), wind speed (m/s) with the concentration of criterion air pollutants (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, CO, O<sub>3</sub>, and NH<sub>3</sub>). For this research, the trend of all air pollutants over time was also investigated. The Spearman correlation approach was used to correlate the concentration of air pollutants with the effect of meteorological variables on these pollutants. Comparing the multiple linear regression (MLR) and non-linear regression (MLNR) models permitted to examine the potential influence of meteorological factors on concentrations of air pollutants. According to the trend analysis, the concentration of NH3 in the air of Siliguri is rising, while the concentration of other pollutants is declining. Most pollutants showed a negative correlation with meteorological variables; however, the seasons impacted on how they responded. The comparative regression research results showed that although the linear and non-linear models performed well in predicting particulate matter concentrations, they performed poorly in predicting gaseous contaminants. When considering seasonal fluctuations and meteorological parameters, the results of this research will definitely help to increase the accuracy of air pollution forecasting near future.",

    "abstract": "The large fluctuations in charging loads of electric vehicles (EVs) make short-term forecasting challenging. In order to improve the short-term load forecasting performance of EV charging load, a corresponding model-based multi-channel convolutional neural network and temporal convolutional network (MCCNN-TCN) are proposed. The multi-channel convolutional neural network (MCCNN) can extract the fluctuation characteristics of EV charging load at various time scales, while the temporal convolutional network (TCN) can build a time-series dependence between the fluctuation characteristics and the forecasted load. In addition, an additional BP network maps the selected meteorological and date features into a high-dimensional feature vector, which is spliced with the output of the TCN. According to experimental results employing urban charging station load data from a city in northern China, the proposed model is more accurate than artificial neural network (ANN), long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM), and TCN models. The MCCNN-TCN model outperforms the ANN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and TCN by 14.09%, 25.13%, 27.32%, and 4.48%, respectively, in terms of the mean absolute percentage error.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can be traced to five economic sectors: energy, industry, buildings, transport and AFOLU (agriculture, forestry and other land uses). In this topical review, we synthesise the literature to explain recent trends in global and regional emissions in each of these sectors. To contextualise our review, we present estimates of GHG emissions trends by sector from 1990 to 2018, describing the major sources of emissions growth, stability and decline across ten global regions. Overall, the literature and data emphasise that progress towards reducing GHG emissions has been limited. The prominent global pattern is a continuation of underlying drivers with few signs of emerging limits to demand, nor of a deep shift towards the delivery of low and zero carbon services across sectors. We observe a moderate decarbonisation of energy systems in Europe and North America, driven by fuel switching and the increasing penetration of renewables. By contrast, in rapidly industrialising regions, fossil-based energy systems have continuously expanded, only very recently slowing down in their growth. Strong demand for materials, floor area, energy services and travel have driven emissions growth in the industry, buildings and transport sectors, particularly in Eastern Asia, Southern Asia and South-East Asia. An expansion of agriculture into carbon-dense tropical forest areas has driven recent increases in AFOLU emissions in Latin America, South-East Asia and Africa. Identifying, understanding, and tackling the most persistent and climate-damaging trends across sectors is a fundamental concern for research and policy as humanity treads deeper into the Anthropocene.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A profound transformation of China’s energy system is required to achieve carbon neutrality. Here, we couple Monte Carlo analysis with a bottom-up energy-environment-economy model to generate 3,000 cases with different carbon peak times, technological evolution pathways and cumulative carbon budgets. The results show that if emissions peak in 2025, the carbon neutrality goal calls for a 45–62% electrification rate, 47–78% renewable energy in primary energy supply, 5.2–7.9 TW of solar and wind power, 1.5–2.7 PWh of energy storage usage and 64–1,649 MtCO 2 of negative emissions, and synergistically reducing approximately 80% of local air pollutants compared to the present level in 2050. The emission peak time and cumulative carbon budget have significant impacts on the decarbonization pathways, technology choices, and transition costs. Early peaking reduces welfare losses and prevents overreliance on carbon removal technologies. Technology breakthroughs, production and consumption pattern changes, and policy enhancement are urgently required to achieve carbon neutrality.",

Total global demand for electric energy is growing both in developed and developing economies. The commitment to the decarbonization of economies, which would mean replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources (RES) as well as the electrification of transport and heating as a means to tackle global warming and dangerous climate change, would lead to a surge in electricity consumption worldwide. Hence, it appears reasonable that the electric power sector should embed the principles of sustainable development into its functioning and operation. In addition, events such as the recent European gas crisis that have emerged as a result of the massive deployment of renewables need to be studied and prevented. This review aims at assessing the role of the renewable energy in the sustainable development of the electrical power sector, focusing on the energy providers and consumers represented both by businesses and households that are gradually becoming prosumers on the market of electric energy. Furthermore, it also focuses on the impact of renewables on the utility side and their benefits for the grid.

    "abstract": "Electric Vehicles (EVs) are projected to be one of the major contributors to energy transition in global transportation due to their rapid expansion. High-level EVs integration into the electricity grid will introduce many challenges for the power grid planning, operation, stability, standards, and safety. Therefore, the wide-scale adoption of EVs imposes research and development of charging systems and EV supply equipment (EVSE) to achieve expected charging solutions for EV batteries as well as to improve ancillary services. Analysis of the status of EV charging technologies is important to accelerate EV adoption with advanced control strategies to discover a remedial solution for negative impacts and to enhance desired charging efficiency and grid support. This paper presents a comprehensive review of EV charging technologies, international standards, the architecture of EV charging stations, and the power converter configurations of EV charging systems. The charging systems require a dedicated converter topology, a control strategy, compatibility with standards, and grid codes for charging and discharging to ensure optimum operation and enhance grid support. An overview of different charging systems in terms of onboard and off-board chargers, AC-DC and DC-DC converter configuration, and AC and DC-based charging station architectures are evaluated. In addition, recent charging systems which are integrated with renewable energy sources are presented to identify the power train of modern charging stations. Finally, future trends and challenges in EV charging and grid integration issues are summarized as the future direction of the research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract New technologies, systems, societal organization and policies for energy saving are urgently needed in the context of accelerated climate change, the Ukraine conflict and the past coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. For instance, concerns about market and policy responses that could lead to new lock-ins, such as investing in liquefied natural gas infrastructure and using all available fossil fuels to compensate for Russian gas supply cuts, may hinder decarbonization efforts. Here we review energy-saving solutions with a focus on the actual energy crisis, green alternatives to fossil fuel heating, energy saving in buildings and transportation, artificial intelligence for sustainable energy, and implications for the environment and society. Green alternatives include biomass boilers and stoves, hybrid heat pumps, geothermal heating, solar thermal systems, solar photovoltaics systems into electric boilers, compressed natural gas and hydrogen. We also detail case studies in Germany which is planning a 100% renewable energy switch by 2050 and developing the storage of compressed air in China, with emphasis on technical and economic aspects. The global energy consumption in 2020 was 30.01% for the industry, 26.18% for transport, and 22.08% for residential sectors. 10–40% of energy consumption can be reduced using renewable energy sources, passive design strategies, smart grid analytics, energy-efficient building systems, and intelligent energy monitoring. Electric vehicles offer the highest cost-per-kilometer reduction of 75% and the lowest energy loss of 33%, yet battery-related issues, cost, and weight are challenging. 5–30% of energy can be saved using automated and networked vehicles. Artificial intelligence shows a huge potential in energy saving by improving weather forecasting and machine maintenance and enabling connectivity across homes, workplaces, and transportation. For instance, 18.97–42.60% of energy consumption can be reduced in buildings through deep neural networking. In the electricity sector, artificial intelligence can automate power generation, distribution, and transmission operations, balance the grid without human intervention, enable lightning-speed trading and arbitrage decisions at scale, and eliminate the need for manual adjustments by end-users.",

    "abstract": "The use of fossil fuels has contributed to climate change and global warming, which has led to a growing need for renewable and ecologically friendly alternatives to these. It is accepted that renewable energy sources are the ideal option to substitute fossil fuels in the near future. Significant progress has been made to produce renewable energy sources with acceptable prices at a commercial scale, such as solar, wind, and biomass energies. This success has been due to technological advances that can use renewable energy sources effectively at lower prices. More work is needed to maximize the capacity of renewable energy sources with a focus on their dispatchability, where the function of storage is considered crucial. Furthermore, hybrid renewable energy systems are needed with good energy management to balance the various renewable energy sources’ production/consumption/storage.

    "abstract": "Abstract The global shift from a fossil fuel-based to an electrical-based society is commonly viewed as an ecological improvement. However, the electrical power industry is a major source of carbon dioxide emissions, and incorporating renewable energy can still negatively impact the environment. Despite rising research in renewable energy, the impact of renewable energy consumption on the environment is poorly known. Here, we review the integration of renewable energies into the electricity sector from social, environmental, and economic perspectives. We found that implementing solar photovoltaic, battery storage, wind, hydropower, and bioenergy can provide 504,000 jobs in 2030 and 4.18 million jobs in 2050. For desalinization, photovoltaic/wind/battery storage systems supported by a diesel generator can reduce the cost of water production by 69% and adverse environmental effects by 90%, compared to full fossil fuel systems. The potential of carbon emission reduction increases with the percentage of renewable energy sources utilized. The photovoltaic/wind/hydroelectric system is the most effective in addressing climate change, producing a 2.11–5.46% increase in power generation and a 3.74–71.61% guarantee in share ratios. Compared to single energy systems, hybrid energy systems are more reliable and better equipped to withstand the impacts of climate change on the power supply.",

    "abstract": "Agriculture is the backbone of the Ethiopian economy, and the agricultural sector is dominated by smallholder farming systems. The farming systems are facing constraints such as small land size, lack of resources, and increasing degradation of soil quality that hamper sustainable crop production and food security. The effects of climate change (e.g., frequent occurrence of extreme weather events) exacerbate these problems. Applying appropriate technologies like climate-smart agriculture (CSA) can help to resolve the constraints of smallholder farming systems. This paper provides a comprehensive overview regarding opportunities and challenges of traditional and newly developed CSA practices in Ethiopia, such as integrated soil fertility management, water harvesting, and agroforestry. These practices are commonly related to drought resilience, stability of crop yields, carbon sequestration, greenhouse gas mitigation, and higher household income. However, the adoption of the practices by smallholder farmers is often limited, mainly due to shortage of cropland, land tenure issues, lack of adequate knowledge about CSA, slow return on investments, and insufficient policy and implementation schemes. It is suggested that additional measures be developed and made available to help CSA practices become more prevalent in smallholder farming systems. The measures should include the utilization of degraded and marginal lands, improvement of the soil organic matter management, provision of capacity-building opportunities and financial support, as well as the development of specific policies for smallholder farming.",

As renewable energy emits no or low greenhouse gases, more countries are trying to increase the use of energies from renewable sources. At the same time, no matter developed or developing, nations have to maintain economic growth. By collecting SCI/SSCI indexed peer-reviewed journal articles, this article systematically reviews the consumption nexus of renewable energy and economic growth. A total of 46 articles have been reviewed following the PRISMA guidelines from 2010 to 2021. Our review research shows that renewable energy does not hinder economic growth for both developing and developed countries, whereas, there is little significance of consuming renewable energy (threshold level) on economic growth for developed countries.",

    "abstract": "The exponentially growing contribution of renewable energy sources in the electricity mix requires large systems for energy storage to tackle resources intermittency. In this context, the technologies for hydrogen production offer a clean and versatile alternative to boost renewables penetration and energy security. Hydrogen production as a strategy for the decarbonization of the energy sources mix has been investigated since the beginning of the 1990s. The stationary sector, i.e. all parts of the economy excluding the transportation sector, accounts for almost three-quarters of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions (mass of CO2-eq) in the world associated with power generation. While several publications focus on the hybridization of renewables with traditional energy storage systems or in different pathways of hydrogen use (mainly power-to-gas), this study provides an insightful analysis of the state of art and evolution of renewable hydrogen-based systems (RHS) to power the stationary sector. The analysis started with a thorough review of RHS deployments for power-to-power stationary applications, such as in power generation, industry, residence, commercial building, and critical infrastructure. Then, a detailed evaluation of relevant techno-economic parameters such as levelized cost of energy (LCOE), hydrogen roundtrip efficiency (HRE), loss of power supply probability (LPSP), self-sufficiency ratio (SSR), or renewable fraction (fRES) is provided. Subsequently, lab-scale plants and pilot projects together with current market trends and commercial uptake of RHS and fuel cell systems are examined. Finally, the future techno-economic barriers and challenges for short and medium-term deployment of RHS are identified and discussed.",

    "abstract": "World leaders and scientists have been putting immense efforts into strengthening energy security and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by meeting growing energy demand for the last couple of decades. Their efforts accelerate the need for large-scale renewable energy resources (RER) integration into existing electricity grids. The intermittent nature of the dominant RER, e.g., solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind systems, poses operational and technical challenges in their effective integration by hampering network reliability and stability. This article reviews and discusses the challenges reported due to the grid integration of solar PV systems and relevant proposed solutions. Among various technical challenges, it reviews the non-dispatch-ability, power quality, angular and voltage stability, reactive power support, and fault ride-through capability related to solar PV systems grid integration. Also, it addresses relevant socio-economic, environmental, and electricity market challenges. Finally, it highlights the proposed solution methodologies, including grid codes, advanced control strategies, energy storage systems, and renewable energy policies to combat the discussed challenges. The findings of this article assist the power system scholars and researchers in conducting further research in this field. Furthermore, it helps the decision-makers to choose the appropriate technologies to deal with the anticipated challenges associated with the grid integration of PV systems.",

Here we assess the effectiveness of several widely considered policy options (electrification, light-weighting, retrofitting, scrapping, regulated manufacturing standards and modal shift) in achieving the transition to sustainable urban mobility in terms of their emissions and energy impact until 2050. Our analysis investigates the severity of actions needed to comply with Paris compliant regional sub-sectoral carbon budgets. We introduce the Urban Transport Policy Model (UTPM) for passenger car fleets and use London as an urban case study to show that current policies are insufficient to meet climate targets. We conclude that, as well as implementation of emission-reducing changes in vehicle design, a rapid and large-scale reduction in car use is necessary to meet stringent carbon budgets and avoid high energy demand. Yet, without increased consensus in sub-national and sectoral carbon budgets, the scale of reduction necessary stays uncertain. Nevertheless, it is certain we need to act urgently and intensively across all policy mechanisms available as well as developing new policy options.",

Today, the agriculture sector faces several challenges, such as population growth, increasing energy demands, labor shortages, and global warming. Increases in energy demand cause many challenges worldwide; therefore, many methods are suggested to achieve energy independence from fossil fuels and reduce emissions. From a long-term point of view, the electrification of agricultural vehicles and renewable energy sources appear to be an essential step for robotic and smart farming in Agriculture 5.0. The trend of technological growth using fully autonomous robots in the agricultural sector seems to be one of the emerging technologies to tackle the increased demand for food and address environmental issues. The development of electric vehicles, alternative green fuels, and more energy-efficient technologies such as hybrid electric, robotic, and autonomous vehicles is increasing and improving work quality and operator comfort. Furthermore, related digital technologies such as advanced network communication, artificial intelligence techniques, and blockchain are discussed to understand the challenges and opportunities in industry and research.",
